                        EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




1. INTRODUCTION

Household water treatment (HWT) interventions may play an important role in
protecting public health where existing water sources, including those delivered via a
piped network or other improved sources, are untreated, are not treated properly or
become contaminated during distribution or storage (UNICEF & WHO, 2009).
    HWT applications are any of a range of technologies, devices or methods
employed for the purposes of treating water at the household level or at the point
of use in other settings, such as schools, health-care facilities and other community
locations. Point-of-use water treatment is another term used for HWT. Proper household
storage, including use of closed or narrow-necked containers to prevent contact with
contaminated hands, is an essential component of household water management, but
is not the focus of this document.
    Properly formulated and locally relevant performance speciﬁcations are needed
to protect users and inform decision-making regarding selection of technologies or
approaches. This document provides a basis by which to evaluate the microbiological
performance of HWT options by:

s establishing a series of health-based microbiological performance targets, ranging
  from an interim target to highly protective, to encourage incremental improvements
  in water safety (sections 2 and 3 and Appendix 1); and
s providing guidance to inform the development of new HWT testing protocols or
  supplement existing protocols (Appendix 2).

It also describes additional factors, including:

s those pertaining to national-level technology evaluation or veriﬁcation programmes
   (Appendix 3); and
s justiﬁcation for use of quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) and
   performance targets for three classes of pathogens (Appendix 4).

    These microbiological performance targets and testing protocols are intended
to inform implementers, protect users and encourage technology development by
providing a risk-based framework to assess the performance of HWT interventions.
The document provides a basis to inform the development or revision of national
or international technology performance evaluation programmes. It is underpinned
by concepts established in the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Guidelines for
drinking-water quality (GDWQ), and the laboratory methods described are meant to
be relevant in resource-limited settings. This document does not describe targets or
protocols for chemical contaminants, although many of the same concepts regarding
risk-based performance targets are relevant to this group of contaminants. The intended
audiences are 1) national-level certiﬁcation organizations, 2) regulatory authorities,
3) those involved in developing and evaluating technologies, including universities
and researchers, and 4) manufacturers and implementers of HWT technologies.
    The recommendations made in this document are advisory in nature and may
be adapted to local contexts by regulatory agencies or national authorities, where
applicable, including for product certiﬁcation, pre-intervention performance evaluation
or technology development and selection.

2. HEALTH-BASED PERFORMANCE TARGETS

The performance targets presented in this document were determined by applying the
concept of tolerable disease burden (acceptable risk) as set forth in the fourth edition
of the GDWQ (WHO, 2011). The GDWQ deﬁne the tolerable burden of disease
as an upper limit of 10−6 disability-adjusted life year (DALY) per person per year
(see Box 1).


     Box 1. Disability-adjusted life year (DALY)

     A common basis for comparing health outcomes is the disability-adjusted life year
     (DALY), now used extensively by WHO and others to estimate and compare burdens
     of disease and injuries (Havelaar & Melse, 2003). Health effects are weighted by
     severity from 0 (good health) to 1 (death). Effects are multiplied by the duration of
     the illness and the population affected to obtain a standardized estimate of total
     disease burden and premature death. DALYs thus represent the years of life lost due
     to mortality (years of life lost, YLL) and the years of life lived with disability (YLD) due
     to illness, standardized by outcome severity weights (Havelaar & Melse, 2003). The
     DALY metric is computed as: DALY = YLL + YLD. In mathematical terms, 10−6 DALY
     per person per year allows for the tolerable loss of 365 healthy days in a population
     of one million over the course of one year. This DALY limit is equivalent to one excess
     case of cancer per 100 000 people ingesting treated drinking-water over a 70-year
     period. The DALY metric is described further in the GDWQ (WHO, 2011).


    Performance targets are values, expressed in terms of log10 reductions in microbe
concentrations1, that deﬁne treatment requirements in relation to source water quality.
Ideally, these should be derived based on locally relevant data, but as such data are
frequently not available, targets are commonly derived based on assumptions made
in relation to three classes of pathogens present in drinking-water supplies.
    Establishing a clear, causal link between pathogen levels in drinking-water and
waterborne disease is problematic. QMRA provides a mechanism to make this link
explicit based on current water quality data, exposure and dose–response models.
The GDWQ recommend QMRA as an important option to assess risks and inform
management decisions, particularly in situations where epidemiological data do
not exist, until epidemiological data are obtained and/or where epidemiological
studies may not be practical or appropriate. QMRA allows for an estimation of
the health impacts of drinking-water quality control measures in a wide variety of
settings (WHO, 2011). To the extent possible, QMRA takes into consideration and
uses epidemiological data for both exposure assessment and health effects (dose–
response) for risk characterization and estimation.
    Use of QMRA is consistent with the three main WHO water-related guidelines
(drinking-water, wastewater reuse and recreational water). Therefore, application of
QMRA to HWT provides a harmonized framework for an integrated approach to
estimating microbial risks in the water environment in general (Havelaar et al., 2001).

                            EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




2.1 Target pathogens
It is neither feasible nor desirable to derive performance targets for all potentially waterborne
pathogens given both the complexity of analyses required and the lack of sufﬁcient data
available. Thus, targets are derived for reference pathogens representing three classes of
pathogens: bacteria, viruses and protozoa. These three classes are represented because
each class is uniquely distinct in regard to the physicochemical and biological properties of
the pathogens within the class and in terms of resistance to various treatment technologies.
Given that all three classes occur widely in drinking-water supplies in low- and high-income
countries and are associated with enteric disease in children in countries with a high
burden of disease (Levin, 2009), they are all important.
      The reference pathogens for bacteria (Campylobacter jejuni), viruses (rotavirus)
and protozoan parasites (Cryptosporidium) were selected because they are relatively
well characterized, of high public health importance and conservative with respect
to dose–response and infectivity. In other words, if treatment options were in place to
control these reference pathogens, there would be the expectation that other important
pathogens within each class of pathogen would also be controlled.
2.2 Derivation of targets
Methods for deriving microbiological performance targets and default concentrations of
pathogens are given in Appendix 1. Targets were derived using assumed levels of reference
pathogens in untreated water, QMRA models described in the GDWQ and calculated
log10 microbial reductions to meet health-based targets. To address the relatively common
scenario where sufﬁcient local data on relevant pathogens are not available, assumptions
regarding background microbial water quality are used. Additional information on the
analytical QMRA models can be found in chapter 7 of the GDWQ (WHO, 2011).
2.3 Tiered approach
Three recommended levels of performance for the reduction of bacteria, viruses and
protozoa are illustrated in Figure 1. These range from a top-tier target equivalent to the
WHO drinking-water guideline reference level of risk of 10−6 DALY per person per year to
a bottom-tier, “interim” target relevant to the performance of currently available, low-cost
technologies that have demonstrated health improvements. As described in the box
above, DALYs are a common metric used to quantify and compare the burden of disease
associated with different health hazards.
     The top-tier standard of “highly protective” represents those technologies that, if used
correctly and consistently over an entire year, will limit drinking-water disease burden to
10−6 DALY per person. This is an extremely conservative health-based target, and, from a
health perspective, such technologies should be unequivocally recommended for use.
     The second tier, “protective”, has been established to allow for a less stringent level of
tolerable disease excess, yet is still consistent with the goal of providing high-quality, safer water.
The “protective” target deﬁnes pathogen removals that achieve a health-based target of
10−4 DALY per person per year. In areas with a suspected high burden of waterborne disease,
technologies that meet the log removal standards in the second tier would still result in signiﬁcant
health beneﬁts (see Box 2). Both the “highly protective” and “protective” targets are based on the
removal of all three classes of pathogens, the justiﬁcation for which is provided in Appendix 4.
     Recognizing, however, that the “highly protective” and, to a lesser extent, “protective”
targets are conservative and that achievement of these targets may not be the most
cost-effective or achievable option in some situations, an “interim” target has been set.
The “interim” target applies to those technologies that achieve “protective” removal targets
for two classes of pathogens and have a proven impact on reducing diarrhoeal and
waterborne infections. Achievement of this lower-tier target should be seen as an initial
step in an effort to incrementally improve towards the ultimate target of “highly protective”.

Box 2. The tolerable risk concept

The concept of tolerable, allowable or acceptable risk is the basis of the WHO
approach to deriving water quality guidelines and encouraging incremental
improvement. The “reference level of risk” due to exposure from drinking-water
is 10−6 DALY per person per year (refer to chapter 3 of the GDWQ). Setting
performance targets derived from a less stringent level of acceptable risk, such
as 10−4 DALY per person per year, from waterborne exposure may be more
achievable, yet still consistent with the goals of providing better quality, safer water.
In the absence of local data (see section A1.5 in Appendix 1 for more information)
and in applying a precautionary approach, the lowest level of performance in a
given pathogen class from testing results should be used. For example, technologies
resulting in a 5 log10 reduction in bacteria, a 5 log10 reduction in viruses and a
3 log10 reduction in protozoa would fail to meet the “highly protective” target, which
requires a 4 log10 reduction level for protozoa and would therefore achieve the
intermediate “protective” tier (Figure 1).

3. ESTABLISHING HEALTH-BASED PERFORMANCE TARGETS

3.1 General approach and principles

This document presents recommended microbiological performance targets for HWT
technologies and supporting information that may be of use in implementing these at
the national level. The following guiding principles have been used in the development
of these recommendations:

s Technologies should be as effective as possible against all classes of microbes, with
   the goal of incremental improvements towards meeting the WHO recommended
   level of risk of 10−6 DALY per person per year attributable to drinking-water or
   relevant national health-based target.

s Technologies that do not meet the recommended risk-based target of 10−6 DALY
   per person per year may contribute to a substantial reduction in waterborne
   disease risk, particularly when the burden of disease is high. Whereas 10−6 DALY
   per person per year is most protective, setting multiple efﬁcacy levels in a tiered
   approach is intended to stimulate innovation and incremental improvements while
   recognizing the potential beneﬁcial impact of technologies whose performance
   is lower than the highest level. Therefore, an intermediate health-based target of
   10−4 DALY per person per year is proposed.

s Technologies that are effective against two but not all three classes of pathogens
   may be recommended for use if supported by epidemiological evidence of
   positive health impacts. A bottom tier, “interim”, includes technologies that meet
   two but not all three “protective” performance targets and demonstrate health
   gains based on epidemiological evidence. For example, free chlorine disinfection
   is effective against bacteria and viruses, but ineffective against Cryptosporidium,
   an important waterborne protozoan parasite.

s Consistent and continuous use of HWT technologies is required for improvements
   in health associated with the consumption of drinking-water. The goal of HWT is to
   make the water that users consume consistently safer. This means that technologies
   or methods must be continuously used by those whose existing water sources are
   unsafe. Factors related to HWT uptake and consistent, sustained use over the
   long term are critical for realizing health gains. The range of factors associated
   with consistent and sustained use and performance of HWT technologies are not
   within the scope of this document, but may be considered when setting technology
   veriﬁcation guidelines at the local or national level (Appendix 3).

3.2 Default health-based microbiological performance targets

Performance targets were computed based on QMRA models. Further information on
QMRA can be found in Appendix 4 and the GDWQ (WHO, 2011). The recommended
levels of microbiological reduction calculated from QMRA models are presented
in Figure 1 (above) and Table 1. Approaches for demonstrating performance are
discussed further in Box 3.

a
    Assumptions for background water quality used to derive microbial reduction targets where local data are not available.
    These are based on an assumed wastewater content in untreated water of 0.01% by volume, using estimated background
    wastewater concentrations of reference microbes from Volume 2 of the WHO Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater,
    excreta and greywater (WHO, 2006). Local water quality data should be used if available and representative enough
    to inform QMRA using bacteria, viruses and protozoa. The use of alternative background water quality data will result in
    different log10 reductions required to achieve the relevant risk-based targets using the QMRA models as described in the
    GDWQ (WHO, 2011).
b
    Computed as log10 (Cuntreated water / Ctreated water), where C = microbe concentration in water.
c
    Treated water achieving the log10 reduction required to meet the health-based target of 10−4 (“protective”) and 10−6 (“highly
    protective”) DALY per person per year, based on the given assumptions for background water quality and using the QMRA
    models as described in the GDWQ (WHO, 2011).
d
    The concentration of rotavirus is derived from high-income regions as presented in Table 7.4 of the GDWQ. Refer to the
    GDWQ for further explanation and validity for application in low-income regions (WHO, 2011).




       Box 3. Demonstrating performance

       The performance targets are intended to encourage testing of technologies
       using a standardized approach linking microbiological performance data with
       the deﬁned health outcome targets. Scientiﬁcally credible and methodologically
       rigorous performance data meeting the standards of peer-reviewed research should
       be used in establishing performance. Existing international and national testing
       protocols for bacteria, viruses and protozoa (e.g. those published by the United
       States Environmental Protection Agency or NSF International/American National
       Standards Institute) or testing recommendations given in Appendix 2 should be
       used. Locally adapted targets and methodologies may also be developed and
       implemented at the national level by other stakeholders. Such certiﬁcation or product
       testing programmes may establish data reporting requirements, incorporating peer
       review, to meet performance targets.


3.3 Testing protocols

The laboratory testing procedures are described in Appendix 2. These cover a range
of HWT technologies, allow for substitution of non-pathogenic microbial surrogates

                                                             7
             Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




in challenge testing and are intended to be widely accessible and adaptable to local
capabilities and conditions. Protocols describe general requirements for laboratory
and testing facilities; appropriate procedures for experimental setup and test
conditions; production and preparation of reference challenge bacteria, viruses and
protozoa (and alternative non-pathogenic organisms as surrogates); and instructions
for appropriately adding these microbes (“spiking”) to test waters. Both general advice
on production of scientiﬁcally credible testing data and technology- and microbe-
speciﬁc details are given where appropriate. In addition, product certiﬁcation and
labelling are highlighted in Box 4 and discussed in greater depth in Appendix 2.
The testing protocols are intended to be adaptable to local contexts and conditions
while providing a common basis for technology comparison. Further references to
inform creation and implementation of testing protocols are provided in Box 5.


   Box 4. Product certiﬁcation and product labelling

   Requirements for labelling of products may be locally developed and should be
   approved by regulatory agencies at the national level. Labelling should supply
   enough information for consumers to make an informed choice regarding more
   and less effective technologies. Labels should be able to be easily compared and
   understandable. Other reportable quantities may also be locally required, such
   as ﬂow rate or volume per day, expiry date or duration of use if applicable or
   indicator of expiry, and other supporting information regarding the performance
   against contaminants not described in this document (i.e. chemicals).
       WHO does not endorse, certify or approve speciﬁc technologies for drinking-
   water treatment. Conforming to the recommended performance targets in this
   document is not grounds for any product labelling alluding to WHO approval, and
   under no circumstances should the WHO logo or name be used in advertising or
   labelling of products.


   Box 5. Links to other WHO documents

   The microbiological performance targets presented here have been derived using
   the risk-based approach articulated in the GDWQ based on assumed levels of
   pathogens in untreated water from the Guidelines for the safe use of wastewater,
   excreta and greywater. WHO recommends a water safety plan approach to
   drinking-water quality where possible. The following documents provide further
   information. All three can be found online at:

                       EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




APPENDIX 1. DERIVATION OF MICROBIOLOGICAL
PERFORMANCE TARGETS

A1.1 Quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA)

QMRA draws upon advances in chemical risk assessment, dose–response relationships
for microbial pathogens and the epidemiology of infectious disease to predict health
risks associated with exposure to microbial pathogens. This appendix provides
general background information on the methods used to identify and quantify health
risks resulting from exposure to pathogens in drinking-water and the development and
identiﬁcation of health-based targets for water treatment technologies. It is important
to note that QMRA is an evolving methodology that relies on assumptions in the
absence of relevant data, such as background levels of pathogens in untreated
water. The dose–response data used to derive the constants applied in the QMRA
calculations are based on highly controlled studies in which healthy subjects were
given a known concentration of a speciﬁc pathogen and the subsequent effects on
health were carefully assessed.

A1.2 Reference pathogens

The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus and the protozoan parasite
Cryptosporidium are key waterborne reference pathogens cited in the GDWQ
(WHO, 2011) and are used here to derive performance targets. Reference target
pathogens were chosen to represent classes of pathogens in water (bacteria, viruses,
protozoa) with respect to occurrence, concentration and health impact. These are
microbes that are widely present in human populations and in faecally contaminated
water worldwide and whose dose–response relationships and occurrence in water
are relatively well characterized, thus enabling their use as targets for estimating
health risks associated with the presence of bacteria, viruses and protozoa in water.
    These microbes can be used in QMRA models and analyses to estimate the
potential health effects resulting from ingestion of a certain number of these microbes
of each class in water over time. HWT technology challenge testing with these or
with surrogate microbes can be used to calculate log10 reduction values for use in
obtaining waterborne exposures for the risk assessment model. More information on
each reference pathogen is available in the microbial fact sheets found in chapter 11
of the GDWQ (WHO, 2011).

A1.2.1 Campylobacter jejuni
Campylobacter spp. are among the most common bacterial etiological agents of
acute gastroenteritis worldwide (Acheson & Allos, 2001). They are shed in high
concentrations in faeces by infected humans and animals, are infectious for humans
in relatively low numbers and sometimes cause a severe neurological disorder after
enteric infection (Guillain-Barré syndrome). In many parts of the world, Campylobacter
spp. are highly prevalent in livestock animals, including poultry, cattle, swine and
sheep. Campylobacter jejuni is the most commonly isolated species of Campylobacter
associated with infection in humans, and waterborne transmission has been
documented.

              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




A1.2.2 Rotavirus
Rotaviruses are considered to be among the most common causes of infant
gastroenteritis and resulting mortality in the world, causing up to 527 000 deaths
(or 29% of all deaths due to diarrhoea) annually (Parashar et al., 2009). They are
shed in high concentrations in the faeces of infected persons, and they are infectious
for humans at relatively low doses. Also, there are many different human rotaviruses,
and repeated infections are possible because of lack of cross-protection among strains
or subtypes and only short-lived immunity. Most human rotaviruses are transmitted
person to person or in aerosols, but infection via faecally contaminated water is a
possible transmission route. Like other viruses, rotaviruses are relatively resistant to or
unaffected by some water treatment processes.

A1.2.3 Cryptosporidium
Cryptosporidium is a pathogen of concern worldwide. It is an etiological agent of
childhood diarrhoeal disease in both Africa and Asia (Levin, 2009) and was the
organism responsible for the major outbreak of enteric disease in the United States
of America (USA) in 1993 (MacKenzie et al., 1994). In addition, it has also been
shown to be one of the main causes of infection and disease in individuals living with
human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV)/acquired immunodeﬁciency syndrome (AIDS)
(Ghimire, Sapkota & Manandhar, 2004; Mor & Tzipori, 2008) in high disease
burden settings. Cryptosporidium spp. infect a wide range of animals as well as
humans. Of the Cryptosporidium species infecting humans, C. hominis is prevalent.
Faecally shed oocysts of Cryptosporidium spp. are relatively stable and persistent
in the environment, and they are commonly present in faecally contaminated water
worldwide. Oocysts of Cryptosporidium are also relatively resistant to chemical
disinfectants such as chlorine, are infectious at relatively low doses and cause serious
and persistent infection in immunocompromised individuals. Cryptosporidium parvum
and C. hominis are among the most important of waterborne pathogens (Steiner et
al., 1997; Chappell et al., 2006; Tzipori & Widmer, 2008).

A1.3 Estimating default pathogen concentrations

Microbiological performance targets are based on the reduction of microbe levels in
drinking-water to an acceptable risk level and therefore are based on the assumed
background concentration of particular pathogens (by class) in water.
    A conservative estimate of potential pathogen concentrations in untreated water
may be calculated based on estimates of pathogen concentrations in wastewater, for
which pathogen occurrence and distribution have been relatively better characterized
compared with environmental water sources. This is partly based on the fact that
pathogens are relatively more difﬁcult to detect, quantify and identify in typical
drinking-water sources, where they may exist in dilute concentrations. Speciﬁc
pathogens vary spatially and temporally in human and animal populations. In a given
population and geographic area, some pathogens may rarely, if ever, be present, and
others may be present all of the time, but at variable levels, based on the proportion of
the population infected. Tables A1.1 and A1.2 provide estimates of concentrations of
the reference pathogens in faeces and in raw domestic or municipal sewage.

a

    Using Feachem et al.’s (1983) assumptions that persons over 15 years of age excrete 150 g of faeces daily, that persons
    under 15 years of age excrete 75 g of faeces per day and that two thirds of the infected people are under 15 years of age;
    this yields a mean faecal weight of 100 g per infected person per day.
c
    As estimated by Feachem et al. (1983) in their hypothetical “tropical community of 50,000 in a developing country”.
    This would not represent an outbreak situation, where a much higher proportion of the population would be shedding the
    microbe.
d
    Using the following assumptions: 100 litres of sewage per person per day, 90% inactivation of microbes within a short time.
e
    Limited data available. Reported arithmetic mean concentrations in raw sewage vary from less than 100 to 90 700 (Gerba
    et al., 1996). The risk assessment model assumes 1000 rotaviruses per litre of wastewater.

    The numeric values of estimated pathogen concentrations in these tables should
be taken as indicative and not exact. Many factors contribute to the variability of
concentrations of both faecal indicator bacteria and pathogens in faeces, wastewater
and environmental waters. Values can vary depending on per capita daily water use,
diet and other factors inﬂuencing per capita faecal excretion and seasonal factors,
such as wet or dry weather, that can inﬂuence the extent of disease (and shedding)
and concentration of faecal matter in wastewater.
    Using Table A1.1 and the assumption that untreated, uncharacterized water is
0.01% wastewater, background levels of reference pathogens have been estimated
in order to calculate log10 reductions.
    Table A1.3 presents the calculation of required log10 reductions to meet the
WHO reference level of risk, 10−6 DALY per person per year (“highly protective”).
Table A1.4 provides the calculation of the log10 reduction requirements consistent with
“protective” performance, which is based on the reference level of risk of 10−4 DALY
per person per year.

A1.4 Interim performance targets

The “interim” target is directed towards countries with a high disease burden where
drinking-water quality is poor and incremental improvements in pathogen reduction
would be expected to result in signiﬁcant health gains. Historically, such gains have been
demonstrated through modest improvements in drinking-water quality as indicated by
reductions of bacterial indicator species in the range of 90–99% (Frankland, 1885;
Hazen, 1900; Baker, 1948). For example, ﬁeld epidemiological trials indicate that
HWT technologies that meet the “interim” performance target may be associated
with measurable reductions of diarrhoeal diseases in users compared with non-users

                                                         19
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




(Brown, Sobsey & Loomis, 2008). Furthermore, in certain cases, such as free chlorine
disinfection (which is not effective against Cryptosporidium), the existing evidence
based on numerous ﬁeld trials indicates a protective effect against diarrhoeal disease
(Arnold & Colford, 2007). Among all technologies, observed reductions of diarrhoeal
disease risk in shorter-term ﬁeld epidemiological HWT intervention studies are often
in the range of 15–50% (Clasen et al., 2007; Waddington et al., 2009), with the
lower end representing situations where studies incorporated more rigorous methods
to limit bias or the existing drinking-water was of fairly good quality. This suggests that
these technologies may reduce disease burdens and serve as a temporary disease
prevention measure before more efﬁcacious household or community water treatment
technologies can be put in place.
     Technologies in the “interim” target may underperform for one class of pathogens,
but must still provide reductions that meet the health-based target of at least
10−4 DALY for two of the three classes of pathogens. In addition, to achieve the “interim”
level, technologies must demonstrate through epidemiological evidence signiﬁcant
diarrhoeal disease reductions. Criteria for what constitutes credible epidemiological
evidence are outside the scope of this document. It is important to note, however,
from a global normative perspective (i.e. which needs to account for varying local
conditions), that efﬁcacy against all three pathogen classes is preferred. The multi-
barrier approach, discussed in further detail in Appendix 2, should be considered to
address underperformance for one pathogen class.

A1.5 Using local data to calculate microbiological
performance targets

Local data may be used to establish log10 reduction criteria for meeting health-based
targets by employing the framework articulated in chapter 7 of the GDWQ. If such
data are to be used in setting risk-based performance criteria for localized areas, data
should capture seasonal and geographical variability with respect to bacteria, viruses
and protozoa, ideally for reference microbes (Campylobacter jejuni, rotavirus and
Cryptosporidium). Where data are absent or are insufﬁciently detailed, default levels
speciﬁed in this document may be used (see Table A1.1 above). Data on speciﬁc
target pathogens should be used, if possible, when the HWT intervention is intended
to prevent exposure to certain individual pathogens rather than all pathogens that may
be present (e.g. cholera outbreaks). Background data should be sufﬁcient to reliably
estimate the mean or median microbial levels as well as the magnitude of variability of
microbial levels (expressed as standard deviations and 95% conﬁdence intervals) and
also extreme values. These data should include sampling during periods of greater
vulnerability to contamination and likely higher risk (e.g. wet weather, impacts from
known faecal contamination sources such as periodic sewage discharges and other
site-speciﬁc factors that increase faecal contamination). National certiﬁcation or
technology testing programmes may set local requirements based on QMRA principles
articulated here and local microbial data. National certiﬁcation programmes may
also choose to set background assumptions for water quality (microbial counts for
the three classes of pathogens in untreated water) that are based on representative
monitoring data from local, regional or national surveys.

APPENDIX 2. TECHNOLOGY-SPECIFIC TESTING
PROTOCOLS FOR EVALUATION OF HOUSEHOLD WATER
TREATMENT PERFORMANCE

A2.1 Foundation for development and implementation of
technology-speciﬁc testing

Before embarking on laboratory testing, clear technology evaluation programmes
must exist, accompanied by a regulatory and enforcement framework that is adapted
to the local institutional landscape. Rigorous protocols and standard metrics are
needed, which can be effectively communicated to all stakeholders.
    Whereas the technology performance risk-based targets are standard measures
that may be adopted internationally, testing programmes and speciﬁc requirements
for individual technologies may vary according to local needs and local resources.
This document is intended to provide a basis for the creation of such guidelines and
protocols.
    Veriﬁcation programmes need to be placed within a carefully considered
institutional structure. National veriﬁcation programmes may need to consider:

s acceptability and applicability of existing microbiological performance or
    epidemiological data to local approval of technologies for use;
s   scope and content of the testing protocols;
s   approval of technology-speciﬁc testing protocols;
s   regulatory authority;
s   enforcement of standards and labelling;
s   labelling of products;
s   whether the programme is to be voluntary or compulsory;
s   reporting rules and data quality control;
s   certiﬁcation of testing laboratories and criteria for independent veriﬁcation;
s   recertiﬁcation of products;
s   publishing and disseminating results to maintain transparency;
s   costs of testing and responsible party for paying costs;
s   reciprocity rules recognizing other testing programmes.

    While these and other factors are outside the scope of this document, they
are critical to implementing a successful national HWT technology performance
evaluation, also referred to in some countries as a technology veriﬁcation programme.
The experience of the Bangladesh Environmental Technology Veriﬁcation – Support
to Arsenic Mitigation (BETV-SAM) Project (http://www.betv-sam.org/) has suggested
that a national water treatment technology performance evaluation and veriﬁcation
programme can be developed through the cooperation of sector-wide stakeholders
with support from the private sector. Although the programme is not without limitations,
including the costs and ongoing challenge of facilitating the update of veriﬁcations
after improvements are made to devices, it may provide “lessons learnt” to other
environmental technology veriﬁcation programmes at the national level.

A2.2 Guiding principles and factors to consider when
developing HWT testing protocols

The general approach for developing and implementing technology-speciﬁc testing
can be summarized as identiﬁcation of candidate technologies, laboratory testing
against contaminants of interest and other testing and considerations. These are
described in further detail below:

1) Identiﬁcation of candidate technologies. A wide range of HWT devices and methods
   are now available throughout the world. These technologies vary by cost, availability,
   effectiveness and many other factors. Selection of candidate technologies for corporate,
   government, trade group, nongovernmental organization or multilateral veriﬁcation
   programmes may be based on local or international evidence, availability of technologies
   locally or individual technologies of interest. Preliminary screening of technologies using
   simple, locally relevant metrics may be helpful in determining which ones to subject to
   further testing.

2) Laboratory testing to determine efﬁcacy against contaminants of interest. Because HWT
   is speciﬁcally intended to reduce pathogens in water, microbiological efﬁcacy testing is
   essential to protect end users of technologies. Recommended levels of pathogen removal
   and a generalized approach to technology veriﬁcation are described here. Protocols for
   laboratory testing, data quality control and reporting should be developed locally and
   may be technology speciﬁc.

3) Other testing as necessary, relevant to national conditions. Some of the additional
   considerations that may be of use in technology veriﬁcation locally are described in
   Appendix 3. Because the utility of HWT in protecting public health depends on coverage,
   continued and correct use, and effectiveness under a range of conditions over the long
   term, other factors that may be relevant to HWT sustainability may be included in local
   technology veriﬁcation programmes. Metrics and protocols should be locally relevant
   and developed as appropriate by stakeholders.

In considering the speciﬁc task of developing HWT testing protocols, several important
principles should be considered. These are highlighted below:

s Protocols should result in data that demonstrate the effectiveness of HWT
   technologies against bacteria, viruses and protozoa. HWT technologies ideally
   should demonstrate efﬁcacy in reducing all classes of waterborne microbial
   pathogens. If only two classes of pathogens are removed effectively, the technology
   must demonstrate health beneﬁts in order to achieve the “interim” target. For further
   explanation, refer to section 2.3 of the main text.

s Where possible, existing testing protocols should be used or adapted. A number
   of protocols for microbiological testing of water treatment technologies exist and
   may be locally applicable. Protocols published by the United States Environmental
   Protection Agency (USEPA) and NSF International (NSF)/American National


                                                 22

   Standards Institute (ANSI) (USEPA, 1987; NSF, 2003) are methodologically
   rigorous and, if properly applied, can result in scientiﬁcally credible microbiological
   performance data.

s Different technologies may require different approaches to demonstrating
   performance. The wide range of HWT options now in use may limit the utility of a
   single standardized protocol.

s Protocols should be rigorous but ﬂexible. Options should exist to enable protocols
   to be adapted to new technologies, alternative test microbes and different contexts,
   as long as scientiﬁcally credible evidence is the result.

s Laboratory testing should closely model actual ﬁeld use. Performance testing under
   simulated ﬁeld use conditions may yield data that more closely estimate long-term
   effectiveness in actual household use.

s Protocols may be locally developed or adapted. Laboratory and human capacities
   vary. Protocols are not useful if they are not possible given local resources and
   constraints. Suggested protocols in this document are sensitive to this and can be
   accomplished with basic microbiological laboratory capacity. Locally developed
   protocols to demonstrate performance may be more suited to local conditions.
   Standard operating procedures for laboratory work and reporting should be
   developed locally.

s Protocols should be accompanied by an appropriate institutional framework.
   Technology performance testing data need to be locally interpreted and acted upon
   so that users can beneﬁt from the information generated in testing programmes.
   The process of designing and implementing technology veriﬁcation programmes is
   complex and beneﬁts from the input of a wide range of stakeholders.

    Testing procedures to characterize or verify technology performance need to
include a range of key operational parameters that are known to inﬂuence microbial
reduction efﬁciency. Such testing should present a reasonable challenge to the
effectiveness of the technology against microbial pathogens in water. Some of the key
known parameters affecting HWT technology performance are given in Table A2.1.
These factors should be considered in developing or implementing technology-speciﬁc
testing protocols.

A2.3 Choice of candidate technologies

Reviews of HWT and safe storage technologies have advanced the current knowledge
about practical aspects of these interventions and their applications (Sobsey, 2002; IRC,
2005; Hygiene Improvement Project, 2006; Lantagne, Quick & Mintz, 2006). Physical
methods for small-scale water treatment include boiling, heating (using fuel and solar),
ﬁltering, settling and ultraviolet (UV) radiation (solar or UV lamps). Chemical methods
include coagulation–ﬂocculation and precipitation, ion exchange, chemical disinfection
with germicidal agents (primarily chlorine) and adsorption. Combinations of these methods
simultaneously or sequentially (e.g. coagulation combined with disinfection) often yield more
effective results as “multi-barrier” technologies (Souter et al., 2003). Other combinations

or multiple barriers are media ﬁltration followed by chemical disinfection, media ﬁltration
followed by membrane ﬁltration or composite ﬁltration combined with chemical disinfection.
The above-mentioned reviews as well as other reviews of technologies have suggested that
the success of interventions is highly context speciﬁc, with no one technology or method
representing a universal best solution (Clasen et al., 2007). The availability of materials, the
quality of raw water available, cultural factors and user preferences or cost may determine
which technology is most suited to HWT applications in resource-limited settings, such as
technologically less developed countries.

A2.4 Experimental setup and test conditions

Microbiological testing protocols described below are intended to be adaptable to local
contexts while providing a common basis for technology performance evaluation in the
absence of locally developed technology testing or veriﬁcation programmes. The scope of
these protocols is restricted to microbiological performance and provides general guidance
and recommendations for scientiﬁcally credible technology-speciﬁc testing of HWT. These
protocols represent one, but not the only, method for demonstrating microbiological
performance.
    To the extent possible, experimental setups for these HWT technologies should model
actual use conditions for the target context. For example, media or membrane ﬁlters should
be tested over time, using intermittent ﬂow, for the typical length of ﬁlter runs or use cycles,
including periodic cleaning, and with water qualities representative of or worse than those
of the water to be treated (i.e. “worst case” water, such as that given as “test water 2” in
Table A2.2). Solar or chemical disinfection should be tested as batch processes, if this is
how they are to be used in practice, and with water that has a physicochemical quality
similar to or worse than that of the water to be treated, providing conditions that will yield a
conservative estimate of the technology’s performance in the ﬁeld. Testing over the expected
or claimed duration of use of the treatment technology, such as the total volume of water
treatable before replacement of a functional component (e.g. a ﬁlter element, disinfectant
delivery module or UV lamp), should be done to document the ability to achieve effective
performance over this duration of use.

              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




    Speciﬁc parameters for use in technology performance evaluation and validation
studies are given below as general guidelines. The actual experimental setup for
each candidate technology, however, should, to the extent possible, exactly reﬂect
or model the manufacturer’s or implementer’s recommendations for daily household
use. This may encompass test water volumes treated, processing times (e.g. contact
or exposure times or ﬂow rates), temperature or other relevant physical conditions,
and representativeness of raw water quality (e.g. maximum turbidity and pH range).
Where testing is to be done over time (e.g. with granular media, porous or membrane
ﬁlters), at least 20 litres per day is indicated as the appropriate minimum volume to
be used in laboratory veriﬁcation. For those technologies that treat volumes smaller
than 20 litres, manufacturers’ recommendations should be followed. However, daily
water produced should still be 20 litres per day during testing, as an estimated
minimum drinking-water volume for a household for one day. This has implications
for batch treatment systems in which production of a total of 20 litres per day may
actually require treatment of several batches of the smaller water volumes speciﬁed
by manufacturers.
    Separate individual treatment units should be used for effectiveness testing against
each separate microbe (e.g. Escherichia coli, bacteriophages, Clostridium perfringens
spores) to prevent any interaction between these microbes that could potentially
inﬂuence the validity of the treatment performance and test microbe assays. For
example, E. coli B could be infected by indigenous bacteriophages present in the
challenge water, resulting in unanticipated increased bacteriophage production in the
test water and decreased numbers of E. coli B bacteria due to lysis of the E. coli cells
by the bacteriophages. If the simultaneous use of multiple test microbes is considered,
preliminary experiments should be done in the test water to be used to show that the
concentrations of the added test microbes in the challenge test water do not change
appreciably for a time period corresponding to the treatment time.

A2.4.1 Volume and physicochemical characteristics of water to be
tested
For each water quality condition, at least 20 litres of each challenge water (Table A2.2)
spiked with speciﬁed amounts of test microbes per batch or run or per day should be tested.
Technology challenge tests should be performed over appropriate and representative time
intervals speciﬁed or recommended for using media ﬁlters, UV technologies or membrane/
porous ﬁlters. Suggested non-microbial challenge water quality parameters (pH, turbidity
and temperature) are given in Table A2.2. However, the tested water quality parameters
should also be representative of those in the waters where the technology is to be used,
and local adaptation of these waters may be required. For example, if technologies are
being considered for use in tropical climates, challenge studies for test water 2 can be
done at a temperature of 20 °C or the lowest water temperature expected in the location
of proposed use. If technologies are intended to treat water volumes less than 20 litres (e.g.
1 litre or 10 litres) per batch or per run, then multiple challenge tests with these speciﬁed
smaller water volumes are recommended to document the ability to treat a total of 20 litres
of water per day.

A2.4.2 Recommended materials for adjusting test water
characteristics
The following materials are recommended for adjusting the turbidity and pH of the test water:

Turbidity
s AC Fine test dust, manufactured by AC Spark Plug Division of General Motors, which is
  commonly used in the USA and is speciﬁed for the addition of turbidity in the protocol
  by the USEPA (1987). This material may be difﬁcult to obtain in countries outside North
  America.
s Finely ground dry clay. This could be any clay representative of the type of clay found
  in soils and therefore in waters where the technologies will be used.
s Naturally occurring turbidity in test water. If local waters where the technology is to
  be used are available, these waters should be tested with their naturally occurring
  turbidity. Waters with different levels of turbidity can be obtained by collecting samples
  at different times when differing conditions (e.g. rainfall events) have created different
  turbidity levels. Water collected at different times and having different turbidities can be
  blended to create test waters with speciﬁc target turbidities. If necessary, the turbidity
  of these collected waters can be adjusted to target levels. The turbidity of test waters
  can be reduced by settling (plain sedimentation) and collecting (decanting) the resulting
  supernatant water, which has reduced turbidity. The turbidity of test waters can be
  increased by settling, removing (decanting) the resulting supernatant and retaining the
  resulting bottom water, which has increased turbidity.

pH
s Inorganic acids or bases (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sodium hydroxide).

    Consideration must be given to the order of adjusting turbidity and pH when using
certain clays. This is because the clay as turbidity material could change the pH, and
changing the pH could also cause previously added turbidity material to precipitate or
coagulate.

A2.5 Technology-speciﬁc testing protocols

The following sections describe common HWT technologies and provide recommended
technology-speciﬁc testing procedures. These may be adapted for use as needed,
consistent with the guiding principles for performance testing articulated previously. These
recommendations are not intended to be comprehensive but are a guide to developing
detailed testing protocols that will, if executed competently, result in scientiﬁcally credible
testing data. We recommend reviewing existing studies from the peer-reviewed scientiﬁc
literature for additional information to aid in designing and conducting appropriate studies
to establish the microbiological performance of speciﬁc HWT technologies.

A2.5.1 Chemical disinfection
Chemical disinfection of drinking-water includes any chlorine- or iodine-based technologies,
including chlorine dioxide, as well as bromine, ozone, other oxidants, strong acids and
bases, ferrates and some antimicrobial metals (e.g. silver and copper). Chemical disinfection
is most widely done with technologies using free chlorine (hypochlorous acid) and, to lesser



                                            27
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




extents, dicyanurates and tricyanurates of free chlorine, chloramines, chlorine dioxide or
other forms of chlorine oxidants. The chlorine, bromine and iodine technologies as well as
ozone and other oxidants all share similar mechanistic features. Disinfection with metals
has been done with soluble, colloidal and larger solid (metallic) forms added to water.
Disinfection of household drinking-water in developing countries is done primarily with
free chlorine, however. This is because it is quite effective, widely available, easy to dose
properly in principle and inexpensive. Disinfection of drinking-water with iodine, which
is also a strong oxidant, is generally not recommended for extended use. This is because
there are concerns about its adverse biological (toxic) effects on certain metabolic functions
and particularly effects on the thyroid gland. Furthermore, elemental iodine is difﬁcult to
prepare, handle and deliver to water as a solution. Iodine can be used in emergency or
other short-term interventions where other options are not indicated. Iodine can be delivered
to water through several means, including aqueous solutions, tablets or iodinated synthetic
polymer resins that slowly release active iodine. Tetraglycine hydroperiodide tablets that
liberate free iodine in water have been widely used in ﬁeld military and recreational
settings. Ozone is not recommended for household water treatment. This is because it is
difﬁcult and expensive to generate at controlled doses in drinking-water and it requires
a reliable source of energy to power the ozone generator. Strong acids or bases are
not recommended as chemical disinfectants for drinking-water, as they are hazardous
chemicals that can alter the pH of the water to dangerously low or high levels. However, as
an emergency or short-term intervention, the juices of some citrus fruits, such as limes and
lemons, can be added to water to inactivate Vibrio cholerae bacteria, if enough is added
to sufﬁciently lower the pH of the water (probably to pH less than 4.5) (Sobsey, 2002). The
advisability of using silver and copper as drinking-water disinfectants remains uncertain
due to the lack of evidence of efﬁcacy supported by performance technology evaluations
as proposed in this document.
     Chlorination is the chemical treatment method that had such a dramatic effect on
public health in the more technologically developed countries over the last century. It
has proven successful in HWT applications as well, although not in all cases. Among
the most successful intervention models is the United States Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention/WHO Safe Water system developed in the 1990s (Mintz, Reiff &
Tauxe, 1995). A systematic review of 21 point-of-use chlorination studies yielded
a pooled risk ratio of 0.71 (95% conﬁdence interval = 0.58–0.87) for diarrhoeal
disease in children who used the intervention, although the authors noted that the
median study length (30 weeks) was short (Arnold & Colford, 2007).
     Laboratory veriﬁcation of chemical disinfectant technologies should follow the
manufacturer’s or implementer’s recommendations for daily HWT use in terms of dose
and contact time as well as quality and quantity of the water to be treated. Important
considerations are how the chemical is dosed into the water, mixed and allowed to
react over time. For some well-established chemical disinfectants, such as free chlorine
(hypochlorous acid/hypochlorite), the parameters for dosing and contact time are well
established. However, adaptations to household use may require some departures from
the use practices typically employed in community water supply systems. Typically,
hypochlorous acid for HWT use is added to water as a concentrated solution (typically
as 0.5–6% hypochlorous acid) or as a tablet to provide a dose of about 3 mg/l (range
1–5 mg/l). As with its use in community water supplies, it is desirable to maintain a
measurable free chlorine residual in the water throughout the period of water use. In
addition to determining chemical disinfectant dose, contact time and maintenance of a


                                                 28
                          EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




residual, testing procedures also need to specify or at least measure temperature and
other key water quality parameters that can inﬂuence disinfection efﬁcacy, such as pH,
turbidity and chlorine-demanding solutes such as dissolved organic matter and ammonia.
At a minimum, test waters 1 and 2 (Table A2.2) should be used to establish effectiveness
over a range of water quality characteristics. In testing microbial inactivation efﬁcacy, it is
necessary to measure the initial concentration of the target microbes in the water as well as
the microbe concentration remaining after one or more periods of exposure (contact times).
Further details are given below. When samples of chemically disinfected water are taken
for microbe analysis after an exposure period (a speciﬁed contact time), the disinfectant
chemical in the water should be immediately chemically neutralized (i.e. converted to a
form lacking antimicrobial activity) to end further activity against the microbes in the test
water sample. In the case of free chlorine, for example, such chemical neutralization is
done by adding a reducing agent such as sodium thiosulfate or sodium bisulﬁte to the test
water sample following exposure.

A2.5.1.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
Batches (speciﬁed volumes) of challenge waters of deﬁned quality are spiked
(experimentally contaminated with target microbes) and then treated or processed by the
chemical disinfection technology according to the instructions given for household use.
Relevant parameters to be controlled and monitored include water quality, chemical dose,
mixing, contact time, temperature and storage conditions of the disinfected water. Samples
of untreated (raw challenge) water and treated water are taken for analysis according
to microbiological methods outlined below. As noted above, it is essential to chemically
neutralize chlorine in samples to be analysed for microbes at the time they are taken to stop
further microbiocidal action beyond the sampling time. Failure to do this allows chlorine or
other chemical disinfectants to continue to exert antimicrobial activity beyond the sampling
time, resulting in an overestimation of the extent of microbial inactivation. A minimum of
three batch processes for each microbial challenge is recommended.

A2.5.1.2 Special considerations
The choice of target microbes is an important consideration in technology veriﬁcation
studies for chemical disinfection of household water by chlorine or other oxidants. It is
preferable to do such studies with the microbes that are known to be present in the source
water and pose the highest waterborne disease burden. If the important waterborne
pathogens are not known or studies with the known, relevant pathogens are not possible,
it is recommended that test challenge waters be spiked with sufﬁcient concentrations of
indicator bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasite surrogates to follow the extent and
possibly the kinetics of inactivation over time. Recommended indicator bacteria, viruses
and surrogates for protozoan parasites are, respectively, Escherichia coli, bacteriophages
of E. coli (coliphages) and spores of either Clostridium perfringens or Bacillus spp. to
document log reductions by chlorine or other chemical disinfection treatment. Care must be
taken to prepare microbial stocks for spiking that do not add excessive chlorine demand to
the test water. Microbial stocks may need to be puriﬁed to reduce their chlorine (or other
test disinfectant) demand prior to use in spiking studies. Preliminary studies may be needed
to ensure the absence of excessive chlorine demand in spiked test waters. Doing challenge
studies with a given test water and speciﬁed conditions of temperature, pH and other
key variables in triplicate at a minimum and performing microbial assays in triplicate are
recommended. It is recommended that a minimum 20-litre volume be subjected to treatment
to account for daily water use in the home. However, larger or smaller volumes can be
                                            29
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




tested if a pre-made disinfectant dose unit (such as a tablet) is intended for a speciﬁed
volume other than 20 litres. Multiple test units in parallel may be used if the unit volume
to be treated is less than 20 litres in order to quantify the time burden and other uses of
resources by household members in treating their water.
    Measuring the pH of test waters as well as the concentrations of certain solutes
in the test waters is of particular importance, because some chemical disinfectants,
such as free chlorine and chlorine dioxide, differ in microbiocidal efﬁcacy at low and
high pH. Free chlorine is more effective as a microbiocide as hypochlorous acid,
which predominates at low pH (pH 6 or lower), than as hypochlorite ion, which
predominates at higher pH (pH 9 or higher). In contrast, chlorine dioxide is more
viricidal at high pH than at low pH. Furthermore, solutes that react with free chlorine,
such as ammonia and organic compounds, can result in the loss of free chlorine
residual and lower microbiocidal activity. Chloramines, which are formed by the
reaction of free chlorine with ammonia, are only weakly microbiocidal compared
with free chlorine, and chlorinated organic compounds resulting from the reaction of
chlorine with natural organic matter are not microbiocidal at all.

A2.5.2 Membrane or structured porous media (ceramic, porous
carbon block, etc.) ﬁlters
Point-of-use water ﬁltration technologies include cloth or ﬁbre ﬁlters, membrane ﬁlters,
porous ceramic ﬁlters, carbon block ﬁlters, composite ﬁlters or similar technologies. These
ﬁlters reduce microbes by a combination of physical and chemical (and, in some cases,
biological) processes, including physical straining, sedimentation and adsorption. Filtration
technologies are ﬁnding increasing application in developing countries where chemical
disinfection or boiling may not always be practical or effective (Colwell et al., 2003).
    Traditional membrane technology is generally expensive and therefore less known
for effectiveness when applied to small-scale drinking-water treatment in developing
countries. However, reverse osmosis, nanoﬁlters and other membrane technologies
are common in developed countries (Hörman et al., 2004), may be used by travellers
to developing countries (Backer, 2002) and are now being evaluated and ﬁeld
implemented in developing countries (Boisson et al., 2010). These advanced ﬁlters
may include composite ﬁlters that employ several methods for reduction of microbes
in water. Some low-cost applications of these types of ﬁlters have been developed and
may have an increasing role to play in the future of HWT in developing countries.
    Cloth ﬁlters, such as those of sari cloth, have been recommended for reducing
Vibrio cholerae in water when these pathogens are associated with copepods or
other eukaryotes in water (Huo et al., 1996; Colwell et al., 2003). These cloths
will not signiﬁcantly retain dispersed bacteria not associated with copepods,
other crustaceans, suspended sediment or large eukaryotes because the pores of
the cloth fabric (> 20 μm) are not sufﬁciently small to exclude bacteria. However,
where appropriate, these ﬁlters can have signiﬁcant health impacts. Colwell et al.
(2003) reported a 48% reduction in cholera associated with use of the ﬁlters over
a 35-month trial that included 65 villages in rural Bangladesh and approximately
133 000 participants. Cloth ﬁlters have also been critical interventions in guinea
worm (dracunculiasis) eradication programmes (Olsen, Magnussen & Anemana,
1997; Aikhomu, Brieger & Kale, 2000).
    Filtration through porous ceramic material is also used to reduce microbes
in water. Ceramic technologies exist in many forms, the most prevalent being the
ceramic “candle” ﬁlters (Clasen et al., 2004; Clasen, Brown & Collin, 2006) or
                                                 30
                           EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




the ceramic “pot” ﬁlters of the type promoted by the nongovernmental organization
Potters for Peace (e.g. Brown, Sobsey & Proum, 2007). Filters are generally gravity-
driven and are often used in a nested bucket system to safely store treated water. Field
trials of commercially produced ceramic “candle” ﬁltration devices have suggested that
they do provide an effective barrier against microbial pathogen indicators in water and
that interventions are associated with signiﬁcant health gains in users compared with
non-users of the technologies. Studies of locally produced, low-cost ceramic pot ﬁlters
in Cambodia have suggested that these interventions are also effective. Diarrhoeal
reductions associated with ﬁlter use were approximately 50% in two ﬁeld trials in rural
Cambodia, with ﬁlters providing a mean 99% reduction of E. coli in household drinking-
water and a mean 90–99% reduction in viruses in laboratory testing.
     Filters having a structured porous barrier to retain microbes and other contaminants should
be tested according to the implementer’s or manufacturer’s recommendations for use in the
target setting. A ﬂow rate, average volume treated per day (minimum 20 litres) and other
operational parameters that closely mimic actual household use conditions should be used.
As with chemical disinfection, volumes of test waters of deﬁned quality should be spiked with
known concentrations of target microbes and treated by the ﬁltration process, and both the
initial (spiked) feed water and the treated ﬁltrate water should be assayed to determine the
microbial concentrations and extent of microbial reduction. At a minimum, test waters 1 and 2
(Table A2.2) should be used to establish effectiveness over a range of water quality characteristics.

A2.5.2.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
Because the effectiveness of ﬁltration technologies is known to vary over time, a minimum time
corresponding to an anticipated use cycle before routine maintenance, cleaning or replacement
should be used for veriﬁcation testing. If manufacturers or implementers do not specify typical
ﬁlter use cycles between cleaning or other maintenance cycles, a minimum 14-day
test period is recommended. Samples of spiked challenge water and ﬁltrate should be taken
for microbial assay at least on days 0, 1, 3, 7 and 14 of the challenge test. If the ﬁltration
technology has a speciﬁed lifetime or if it requires periodic cleaning, challenge testing with
spiked water should take place at intervals of 0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100% of the life cycle
or the cleaning cycle of the ﬁlter and should include challenge testing with spiked water into the
next cycle of use after cleaning to document continued performance. At each sampling time,
other relevant water quality parameters, such as turbidity, should also be measured in challenge
water and ﬁltrate, as well as key operational variables, such as ﬂow rate. A minimum of two
ﬁltration units should be tested in parallel using the same challenge water and test microbes
to document performance reproducibility and detect variability. If the duration of use of the
ﬁlter between cleaning or use cycles is longer than 14 days, the length of the total test period
should be extended according to the manufacturer’s or implementer’s recommendations, and
microbial challenge tests should be performed at intervals corresponding to 0%, 25%, 50%,
75% and 100% of the overall use or life cycle period.

A2.5.2.2 Special considerations
Ceramic and some other structured porous media ﬁlters are regularly cleaned during use in
the household. In challenge tests, ﬁlters should be cleaned according to the implementer’s
or manufacturer’s exact recommendations, including frequency and method of cleaning.
However, in evaluating these ﬁlter technologies, no disinfectants or other antimicrobial
agents should be used on the ﬁlters during cleaning. If these disinfectant agents are
recommended for regular use with the ﬁlter, they should be included in a technology
evaluation performance test under the “multi-barrier” category.

              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




A2.5.3 Granular media ﬁlters
Granular media ﬁlters include ﬁlters containing sand, diatomaceous earth or other particulate
media in packed beds, layers or surfaces over or through which water is passed. These
ﬁlters retain microbes by a combination of physical and chemical processes, including
physical straining, sedimentation and adsorption. Some may also employ chemically
active antimicrobial or bacteriostatic surfaces or other chemical modiﬁcations. Other
granular media ﬁlters are biologically active because they develop layers of microbes and
their associated exopolymers on the surface of or within the granular medium matrix. This
biologically active layer, called the schmutzdecke in conventional slow sand ﬁlters, retains
microbes and often leads to their inactivation and biodegradation. A household-scale ﬁlter
with a biologically active surface layer that can be dosed intermittently with water has been
developed called the BioSand ﬁlter, which is an intermittently operated slow sand ﬁlter
(Stauber et al., 2006). The BioSand system has been the subject of several studies (Kaiser
et al., 2002; Duke et al., 2006; Stauber et al., 2009) suggesting that the ﬁlters can be
effective in reducing waterborne microbes and improving health among users.
    Filters using porous granular media to retain microbes and other contaminants
should be tested according to the implementer’s or manufacturer’s recommendations
for use in the target setting. A ﬂow rate, average volume treated per day (minimum
20 litres) and other operational parameters that closely represent actual household
use conditions should be used. At a minimum, test waters 1 and 2 (Table A2.2) should
be used to establish effectiveness over a range of water quality characteristics.

A2.5.3.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
Because the effectiveness of these technologies is known to vary over time, challenge tests
should be performed using a minimum time period of operation corresponding to the ﬁlter
use cycle recommended by the manufacturer or implementer, including the ﬁlter cleaning
step. If no time period is speciﬁed by the manufacturer or implementer, a minimum time
period of 14 days should be used for veriﬁcation testing. Samples of spiked challenge water
and ﬁltrate should be taken for microbe testing at least on days 0, 1, 3, 5 and 14, and any
cleaning or maintenance operations should be included. If the duration of use of the ﬁlter
between cleaning or use cycles is longer than 14 days, the length of the total test period
should be extended according to the manufacturer’s or implementer’s recommendations,
and microbial challenge tests should be performed at intervals corresponding to 0%, 25%,
50%, 75% and 100% of the overall use or life cycle period. Testing replicate ﬁltration units
in parallel using the same challenge water and test microbes to document performance is
recommended, with two parallel ﬁlters at a minimum.

A2.5.3.2 Special considerations
Most granular media ﬁlters require periodic ﬁlter backwashing or other cleaning,
although the frequency of this may depend on raw water characteristics. Backwashing
or cleaning should be conducted during the testing period exactly in accordance with
the manufacturer’s or implementer’s recommendations. It is recommended that technology
evaluation challenge tests be performed over at least one cycle of ﬁlter use, including a
cleaning step, such as backwashing or sand surface harrowing and decanting, and the
subsequent period of ﬁlter operation until the end of the ﬁlter run or use cycle before the
next round of ﬁlter cleaning or maintenance.
    Granular media ﬁlters that are biologically active, such as intermittently operated
slow sand ﬁlters, may “mature” or “ripen” over time, and reductions of some microbes
by such treatment may not reach maximum or optimum performance until the ﬁlter

                                                 32
                         EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




has biologically matured or ripened (Stauber et al., 2006). In challenge tests of such
ﬁlters, the microbial reduction may increase well after a minimum 14-day testing
period, because the ﬁlter was still maturing and had not reached its maximum state of
performance. For such ﬁlters, technology performance data should be collected from
periodic challenge tests over an extended time interval of use to better represent the
microbial reduction capability of the ﬁlter in the target setting and where long periods
of use (e.g. several months per ﬁlter run cycle) are ordinarily indicated or expected.

A2.5.4 Solar disinfection
There are a number of technologies using solar irradiation to disinfect water, and
mechanisms for reduction of microbes and technologies have been well studied (e.g. Acra
et al., 1980; Acra, Raffoul & Karahagopian, 1984; Joyce et al., 1996; Kehoe et al.,
2004; Lonnen et al., 2005; Méndez-Hermida et al., 2005; Berney et al., 2006a,b). Some
use solar radiation to inactivate microbes in either dark or opaque containers by relying
on heat from sunlight energy. Others, such as the SODIS system developed at the Swiss
Federal Agency for Environmental Science and Technology (EAWAG), use clear plastic
containers penetrated by UV radiation from sunlight and rely on the combined action of
the UV radiation, oxidative activity associated with dissolved oxygen and heat. Other
physical forms of solar radiation exposure systems also employ combinations of these solar
radiation effects in other types of containers, such as UV-penetrable bags and panels, to
improve the microbial quality of water. A number of ﬁeld trials have been conducted to
evaluate the health impacts and ﬁeld effectiveness of the technology (Conroy et al., 1996,
1999, 2001; Rainey & Harding, 2005).
     Solar disinfection technologies should be tested in accordance with the
implementer’s or manufacturer’s recommendations for use in the target setting. Incident
solar radiation that controls UV intensity and thermal ﬂux depends on the latitude,
altitude, weather, season, exposure orientation and speciﬁc design features of the
water vessel, and water quality. Therefore, either technology performance evaluation
or veriﬁcation should take place in an area that is representative of the target context
and conditions in terms of incident solar radiation (measured in W/m2) and other
relevant conditions, or these conditions may be simulated in the laboratory and ﬁeld,
for example, according to methods recommended by Oates et al. (2003) or other
scientiﬁcally credible methods.
     Only those results obtained under conditions of testing that are representative of
those equivalent to the speciﬁc setting in which the technology is to be used (e.g.
incident radiation, temperature, water turbidity, length of time exposed to sunlight)
should be considered valid for expected performance in the ﬁeld. If key operating
and environmental conditions vary seasonally in the regions where the technology is
to be used, it is recommended that performance evaluation testing be done to include
representative average (central tendency) and boundary (maximum and minimum)
conditions potentially inﬂuencing performance. At a minimum, test waters 1 and 2
(Table A2.2) should be used to establish effectiveness over a range of water quality
characteristics.

A2.5.4.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
The recommended volume of each quality of challenge water to be tested is 20 litres, which
represents the estimated minimum daily need of a household. Normally, this volume will
need to be distributed among individual polyethylene terephthalate bottles if using SODIS
or similar solar disinfection systems that employ small volumes. Testing of the length of time
                                           33
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




of sunlight exposure, taking into consideration the intensity of the sunlight (sunny day versus
cloudy day), should be according to the speciﬁcations of the manufacturer, implementer or
other testing sponsor. Treated water from individual bottles can be aseptically combined
as a composite sample from which an aliquot can be taken for microbial analysis.
A recommended minimum of three such challenge tests should be performed, each with
triplicate microbial analysis.

A2.5.4.2 Special considerations
Dissolved oxygen in water should be measured both before and after treatment, if possible,
as this has been shown to inﬂuence the microbial effectiveness of solar disinfection
technologies performed in clear (UV-penetrable) plastic bottles. For such technologies,
solar radiation, especially in the UV wavelength range, should also be measured, and UV
ﬂuence (dose) should be calculated, as this is a key contributor to microbial inactivation.
The temperature of the water during exposure should also be measured, as elevated
temperature may also contribute to microbial inactivation. For technologies that use
opaque containers and rely primarily on elevated temperature to inactivate microbes by
pasteurization, temperature should be monitored over time. If there is a particular target
temperature speciﬁed by the technology provider or implementer, the time to reach this
target temperature and the duration of time that water was kept at this target temperature
before ending the treatment period should be recorded. The turbidity of water to be treated
should also be measured, and the extent to which this turbidity either stays suspended in
water or settles in the bottle during sunlight exposure should be considered, as this could
inﬂuence the kinetics and extent of microbial reduction by these solar processes.

A2.5.5 UV light technologies using lamps, including UV light-
emitting diodes
UV radiation has been used in drinking-water treatment for over 100 years (Ward,
1893; Baker, 1948), and its mechanisms for inactivating microbes have now been well
characterized (Sobsey, 1989; Blatchley & Peel, 2001). The technology’s increasing use
is due in part to its proven effectiveness against chlorine-resistant protozoan pathogens,
such as Cryptosporidium and Giardia. A number of drinking-water treatment technologies
employ UV light radiation from UV lamps to inactivate microbes. For household or small-scale
water treatment, most employ low-pressure mercury arc lamps producing monochromatic
UV radiation at a germicidal wavelength of 254 nm. Typically, these technologies allow
water in a vessel or in ﬂow-through reactors to be exposed to the UV radiation from the
UV lamps at sufﬁcient dose (ﬂuence) to inactivate waterborne pathogens.
    Technologies using UV lamps must be tested in accordance with the manufacturer’s or
implementer’s recommendations for use, including speciﬁc properties of the lamps, power
input, water treatment vessel, treatment reactor or orientation of lamp relative to the
water to be treated, incident UV intensity (in mW/cm2 or other standard units), estimated
UV dose delivered (ﬂuence, based on intensity and exposure time), reported in standard
units (e.g. mJ/cm2), and ﬂow rate. At a minimum, test waters 1 and 2 (Table A2.2) should
be used to establish effectiveness over a range of water quality characteristics.

A2.5.5.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
Spiked challenge waters should be treated according to the manufacturer’s or implementer’s
instructions as a batch process. Samples of untreated (raw challenge) and treated water
should be taken for analysis according to the microbiological methods outlined below.
A minimum of three batch processes for each microbial challenge is recommended.
                                                 34
                         EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




A2.5.5.2 Special considerations
Adenoviruses are more resistant to UV disinfection than any known non-pathogenic
surrogate virus. However, the virus surrogate coliphage MS2 is relatively resistant to
UV radiation and can be used to evaluate the performance of UV disinfection HWT
technologies (Thurston-Enriquez et al., 2003). If the UV treatment process is operated as
a ﬂow-though or continuous ﬂow reactor and ﬂow rate can vary within a speciﬁed range,
triplicate spiked water challenge tests should be performed at the average, maximum and
minimum ﬂow rates to document the range of microbiocidal effectiveness across the ﬂow
rate range.

A2.5.6 Thermal (heat-based) technologies
Thermal technologies are those whose primary mechanism for the destruction of microbes in
water is heat produced by burning fuel. This includes boiling and heating to pasteurization
temperatures (typically > 63 °C for 30 minutes). For example, pasteurization (Iijima et
al., 2001) was found to improve household drinking-water quality in a trial in Kenya.
Another ﬁeld trial from Bangladesh demonstrated inactivation of thermotolerant coliforms
using a pasteurization process (Islam & Johnston, 2006). Relatively low heat (55 °C) for
several hours may inactivate key protozoan pathogens in water, such as Cryptosporidium
parvum, Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica (Feachem et al., 1983; Sobsey &
Leland, 2001; Sobsey, 2002; Spinks et al., 2006). Boiling remains the most common form
of household-scale water treatment worldwide, having been used to treat drinking-water
since antiquity.
     Because boiling of drinking-water is the most widespread practice for treating
drinking-water in the world and, in theory, the most effective for reducing pathogens,
it should, like other existing methods of water treatment, not be discouraged when
alternative technologies are not as effective or are less likely to be used correctly,
consistently and continuously. In practice, however, boiling may not be as effective as
other strategies, for various reasons. Disadvantages to boiling include the following:
boiling does not reduce sediment or turbidity; boiling may negatively affect taste;
boiling heats up water so that it cannot be drunk immediately; the temperature
achieved may not be easily measured; and the method may use large amounts of fuel.
Boiling may not be a cost-effective or practical option in many places. Boiled water
still must be safely stored to avoid contamination in the household, as well.
     Technologies that use thermal energy for heat inactivation as the main mechanism
for microbial reductions in water should be tested according to the manufacturer’s or
implementer’s recommendations for use. The speciﬁcs of the temperature required and
the length of time at this temperature that must be maintained for proper treatment
should be included in the testing conditions. At a minimum, test waters 1 and 2
(Table A2.2) should be used to establish effectiveness over a range of water quality
characteristics.

A2.5.6.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
Spiked challenge waters should be treated according to the manufacturer’s or implementer’s
instructions as a batch process. If the process is a ﬂow-through reactor, the manufacturer’s
instructions for operating conditions in challenge tests should be followed. Samples of
untreated (raw challenge) and treated water should be taken for analysis according to the
microbiological methods outlined below. A minimum of three such challenge tests should
be performed, each with triplicate microbiological analysis.


                                           35
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




A2.5.6.2 Special considerations
In thermal treatment processes, it takes time for the water being treated to reach the
target temperature and then for the water to cool before use. Therefore, the changes in
temperature of the water being treated should be measured, and these temperatures should
be compared with those speciﬁed as acceptable by the manufacturer. The rate and extent
of microbial inactivation are dependent on time–temperature conditions, so documenting
these conditions is critical in evaluating performance for microbial reductions. Time–
temperature conditions that are considered acceptable according to the manufacturer’s
or implementer’s speciﬁcations and that are also representative of conditions where the
technology will be used should be used in challenge tests.

A2.5.7 Coagulation–ﬂocculation and/or sedimentation
Coagulation or precipitation is any device or method employing a natural or manufactured
coagulant or precipitant to coagulate and/or precipitate suspended particles, including
microbes, to enhance their sedimentation. Sedimentation is any method for water treatment
using the settling of suspended particles, including microbes, to remove them from the
water. These methods may be used along with cloth or ﬁbre media for a straining step to
remove the ﬂocculated particles (“ﬂoc”) that have formed. This category includes simple
sedimentation, or that achieved without the use of a chemical coagulant. Coagulant–
ﬂocculant products have been tested in the laboratory and ﬁeld (e.g. Rangel et al., 2003;
Reller et al., 2003; Souter et al., 2003; Crump et al., 2004a; Chiller et al., 2006).
Promising results have been achieved with low-cost, locally available coagulants for use in
simple coagulation/ﬁltration systems (Babu & Chaudhuri, 2005).
    Some combination systems are commercial products in the form of granules,
powders or tablets containing a chemical coagulant such as an iron or aluminium salt
and a disinfectant such as chlorine. When added to water, these chemicals coagulate
and ﬂocculate impurities to promote their rapid and efﬁcient sedimentation and also
deliver the chemical disinfectant (e.g. chlorine) to inactivate microbes. To use these
combined coagulant–ﬂocculant–disinfectant products, they are added to speciﬁed
volumes of water, allowed to react for ﬂoc formation, usually with brief mixing to
promote coagulation–ﬂocculation, then allowed to remain unmixed for the ﬂoc to
settle; the clariﬁed supernatant water is then decanted off, usually through a cloth or
other ﬁne mesh medium to strain out remaining particles. The recovered supernatant
is then stored for a period of time to allow for additional chemical reactions and
disinfection to occur before the water is consumed.
    Technology evaluation or veriﬁcation challenge tests of coagulation–ﬂocculation
and sedimentation for the removal of microbes should be performed according to the
manufacturer’s or implementer’s recommendations for normal household use in the
target context. Speciﬁc representative conditions of the volume of water to be treated
(minimum of 20 litres), coagulant dose (if applicable), mixing conditions (e.g. stirring
method) and the speciﬁed or recommended method for removing ﬂoc from the treated
water (physical straining, settling, decanting, etc.) should be included. At a minimum,
test waters 1 and 2 (Table A2.2) should be used to establish effectiveness over a
range of water quality characteristics.

A2.5.7.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
Spiked challenge waters should be treated according to the manufacturer’s or implementer’s
instructions as a batch process. Samples of untreated (raw challenge) and treated water
(e.g. settled supernatant water after coagulation–ﬂocculation and settling) should be taken

                                                 36
                         EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




for analysis according to recommended microbiological methods. A minimum of three
such challenge tests should be performed, each with triplicate microbiological analysis per
sample.

A2.5.7.2 Special considerations
Challenge tests should be performed on volumes of treated water speciﬁed by the
manufacturer or implementer. These volumes may be based on the unit in which the
treatment chemical is provided (e.g. tablet or sachet). Multiple test volumes of challenge
water should be treated if the recommended unit volume to be treated is less than the
recommended 20 litres per day per household. In this case, samples of pretreatment and
post-treatment water to be assayed for microbial and other parameters can be combined
from multiple units or batches tested in parallel.
    Raw water quality is a critical factor in coagulation–ﬂocculation and precipitation.
The efﬁcacy of these physicochemical processes is often highly dependent on such
water quality parameters as pH, dissolved solids, alkalinity, hardness, turbidity and the
concentrations and types of dissolved and colloidal matter. Therefore, the conditions
of these parameters in challenge waters to be tested should be representative of those
where the technology will be used, and they should be within the acceptable range at
which the treatment chemicals can be effectively used.
    For coagulation–ﬂocculation processes, mixing conditions (e.g. speed and
duration) can be critical to effective performance, as can subsequent setting times.
Therefore, challenge tests should be performed under conditions for these parameters
speciﬁed by the manufacturer or implementer.

A2.5.8 Combination (multi-barrier) approaches
Multi-barrier approaches are any combination of the above technologies used together, either
simultaneously or sequentially, for water treatment. Examples include such combinations
as coagulation/disinfection, media ﬁltration/disinfection and media ﬁltration/membrane
ﬁltration. Some combination systems are commercial products in the form of granules,
powders or tablets containing a chemical coagulant such as an iron or aluminium salt and
a disinfectant such as chlorine. When added to water, these chemicals coagulate and
ﬂocculate impurities to promote their rapid and efﬁcient sedimentation and also deliver
the chemical disinfectant (e.g. chlorine) to inactivate microbes. To use these combined
coagulant–ﬂocculant–disinfectant products, they are added to speciﬁed volumes of water,
allowed to react for ﬂoc formation, usually with brief mixing to promote coagulation–
ﬂocculation, then allowed to remain unmixed for the ﬂoc to settle; the clariﬁed supernatant
water is then decanted off, usually through a cloth or other ﬁne mesh medium to strain out
remaining particles. The recovered supernatant is then stored for a period of time to allow
for additional chemical reactions and disinfection to occur before the water is consumed.
    Multi-barrier treatment technologies should be tested according to the manufacturer’s
or implementer’s recommendations for normal household use in the target context.
Challenge tests should be performed at representative and acceptable conditions
for the water volume to be treated (but also meeting the minimum 20 litres for daily
household use), water quality, ﬂow rate (if a continuous ﬂow or ﬂow-through process),
dose (if applicable; measured in the appropriate units) and duration of treatment
(treatment process time or cycle). At a minimum, test waters 1 and 2 (Table A2.2)
should be used to establish effectiveness over a range of water quality characteristics.


                                           37
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




A2.5.8.1 Experimental time period and sampling schedule
Where one component of the treatment system is a media or membrane ﬁltration process,
a minimum treatment time corresponding to that recommended by the manufacturer or
implementer should be used. If no such minimum treatment time is recommended, time
periods that are realistic for the type of process and representative of the conditions where
the technology will be used should be used. For ﬁlters that are used over an extended
period of time, a recommended minimum test period of 14 days should be used for each
challenge test. If appropriate for the technology, a batch test may be used. A minimum
of three such challenge tests should be performed, each with triplicate microbiological
analysis per sample.

A2.5.8.2 Special considerations
Challenge tests of technology performance should be performed using water quality
conditions representative of those where the technology will be used and within the
acceptable range of water quality conditions speciﬁed by the manufacturer or implementer.
At a minimum, three conditions of water quality, representing maximum, minimum and
average conditions in waters from the locations where the technology will be used, should
be tested.
    For combination treatments that include a chemical disinfectant, the guidance
provided above in section A2.5.1 should be followed. In particular, disinfectant
dose, disinfectant residual in treated water and contact time should be measured,
and the residual disinfectant present in the water upon sampling should be chemically
neutralized before performing microbiological analyses.

A2.6 Microbiological testing protocols and laboratory
requirements

A2.6.1 International testing protocols
Laboratory demonstration of the effectiveness of HWT technologies against microbes in
water can be accomplished through several available standard and consensus protocols.
Internationally recognized standards and guidelines for performance or effectiveness
testing exist, such as the USEPA’s Guide standard and protocol for testing microbiological
water puriﬁers (USEPA, 1987) or the NSF’s Protocol P231: Microbiological water puriﬁers
(NSF, 2003). Although existing protocols are rigorous and detailed, they often require
specialized facilities and expertise that may not be widely available in some countries and
other resource-limited settings. Methods presented here are alternatives to existing protocol
standards and guidelines that can be applied to performance testing of HWT technologies
in resource-limited settings.

A2.6.2 Testing facilities and laboratory requirements for HWT
technology performance evaluation
Microbiological challenge testing to meet risk-based performance guidelines or relevant
standards should be performed in adequate facilities. It is recommended that evaluation
of the performance of HWT technologies be done in appropriate and preferably certiﬁed
laboratories by personnel trained and experienced in microbiology and water quality
sciences and their laboratory analytical methods. For technology veriﬁcation studies
with human pathogens, such testing should be done in laboratories certiﬁed as biosafety
level II (WHO, 2004). For technology studies with non-pathogenic microbes, such as
non-pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli, non-pathogenic bacterial spores and bacterial
                                                 38
                          EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




viruses (e.g. coliphages), it is recommended that such testing should be done in laboratories
certiﬁed as biosafety level I (WHO, 2004). If such testing is done in countries where such
biosafety certiﬁcation is not available, laboratories are encouraged to meet and follow the
speciﬁcations described in the WHO Laboratory biosafety manual (WHO, 2004).
    Microbiological performance evaluation for HWT processes is best done by
entities that are already experienced in such technical work and that have developed
or can develop detailed protocols and speciﬁc test plans for such studies. They should
also be knowledgeable of quality assurance and either have developed or be able to
develop a quality assurance project plan for the technology performance evaluation.
Adequate equipment and facilities, trained and experienced staff, protocols, test
plans, standard operating procedures and bench sheets, data management systems
and quality assurance project plans are critical elements for ensuring reliability and

A2.7 Challenge microbes: Selection and preparation

A2.7.1 Challenge microbe levels in test waters
Sufﬁcient test microbes need to be present in or added to test waters to be able to quantify
sufﬁcient reductions by treatment to meet the speciﬁed health-based target. For example,
consider the case where achieving the WHO reference level of risk of 10−6 DALY per
person per year requires a 4 log10 reduction of the test microbe by the HWT technology
and one analyses only 100 ml of the treated water for remaining levels of these microbes
after treatment. Analysing a 100 ml volume of water provides a lower detection limit
of 1 microbe per 100 ml. In this case, there needs to be at least 10 000 (104) of these
microbes per 100 ml of initially seeded water, such that a 4 log10 or greater reduction
would result in 1 or 0 microbes per 100 ml of treated water. That is, the microbes would
be reduced from an initial 10 000 (4 log10) per 100 ml to 1 microbe (0 log10) or less per
100 ml of treated water (initial 4 log10 – ﬁnal 0 log10 = a 4 log10 reduction).

A2.7.2 Microbe choice
The choice of test microbes is critical. The choice is best made from reliable local or regional
data on which pathogens are the most important ones contributing to the population burden
of waterborne disease. The pathogen of greatest risk in causing waterborne disease or
contributing the most to waterborne disease burden is the one to target for control by
HWT or other control measures. Knowing which pathogen poses the greatest waterborne
disease risk makes it possible to choose, verify and implement the technology that will
best reduce concentrations of this pathogen to an acceptable level of risk (e.g. the WHO
reference risk level of 10−6 DALY per person per year). Also, identifying key etiological
agents of waterborne disease risk informs the choice of the candidate technologies to
effectively treat the water and efﬁciently reduce this pathogen and its attendant disease risk.
    For example, if the pathogen of greatest waterborne disease risk and health
burden is Vibrio cholerae (the cause of cholera) in a particular community and it is
known that this pathogen can be extensively reduced by a novel ceramic ﬁlter, solar
disinfection or chlorine to achieve the recommended 10−6 DALY per person per year
reference level of risk, then any of these technologies can be subjected to testing to
verify their effectiveness in achieving the required reduction. Alternatively, if facilities
and resources do not exist for using the bacterium V. cholerae in challenge testing, a
laboratory strain of E. coli might be used as an acceptable surrogate test microbe, as
                                            39
                  Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




it is a bacterium with similar properties and may be more easily grown and handled in
the laboratory. It is a surrogate for the pathogen of concern and is meant to represent
the effectiveness of the technology against all members of its class (bacteria).
     Recommended test pathogens and the suggested alternative pathogen or indicator
microbes to use as substitutes for them in technology performance evaluation or validation
studies are shown in Table A2.3. These microbes are not the only ones to consider, as there
may be other pathogens that are responsible for the greatest waterborne disease burden in
a particular community or country and its water sources, and therefore more appropriate
microbial indicators might be needed for them. If so, another target pathogen of interest
or an indicator for it would be a more appropriate choice for technology performance
evaluation or validation. Appropriate choices for pathogen surrogates in testing should
be determined by parallel testing of the pathogen and the proposed surrogate with the
treatment process or technology in question, a task that has been performed for some
treatment processes, with results in peer-reviewed studies. Above all, the surrogate microbe
should conservatively estimate the extent of reduction efﬁciency of the target pathogen.

                                                          been successfully used for this purpose.

                        EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




    Local laboratory capacity may limit the extent of microbiological testing available,
especially in early product screening. Escherichia coli or other bacterial indicator
species, which may be assayed using kits or other simple, low-cost methods, may be
the only available choice in many contexts. Detecting speciﬁc bacteria as surrogates
or indicators is now facilitated by chromogenic bacteriological media. Such media
contain a speciﬁc substrate that facilitates detection of the target surrogate bacteria
in water containing high background concentrations of other bacteria by a speciﬁc
colour change (in the bacterial colony or in the broth culture medium) indicating the
presence of the target bacteria. Systematic testing of untreated and treated water
spiked with E. coli or another bacterial indicator can provide useful information about
technology effectiveness and can be used to indicate whether a technology or method
reaches the recommended levels of effectiveness for bacteria only. Such testing is
encouraged and can be useful in determining whether a water treatment method
merits further testing. Bacterial tests cannot, however, be used to indicate or infer
levels of effectiveness against other classes of microbes, such as viruses or protozoan
parasites.

A2.7.3 Microbe preparation and state
The methods of preparation and the state of the test microbes to be spiked into test
waters in technology performance evaluation or veriﬁcation challenge studies are
critically important. It is recommended that test microbes be prepared by methods
resulting in reproducible microbial stocks of appropriate and consistent physical,
chemical and biological quality. For most studies, it is recommended that the test
microbes be sufﬁciently puriﬁed and dispersed so as to be discrete particles (as
opposed to aggregates or being attached to or embedded in other particles) and in
suspensions free of excessive solutes and non-microbial particles that could interfere
with disinfection treatment processes.
     It is important to determine the extent to which microbial aggregation, particle
(solids) association and the presence of interfering particles and solutes in water
inﬂuence the performance of an HWT technology. These conditions of the physical state
of the microorganisms and the composition and concentrations of other constituents
in water tend to alter microbe response to treatment and treatment effectiveness, and
they occur widely in environmental waters used for drinking-water supply. However,
determining the effects of these interfering conditions on technology performance in
reducing microbes is best done using test microbes and waters in which these factors
are controlled and well characterized.

A2.7.4 Bacteria
Historically, standards and guidelines for microbiological performance testing of water
treatment technology and resulting treated water quality requirements have been based
upon the reduction of members of the coliform group of bacteria. Now, speciﬁcally
E. coli is the WHO-recommended member of the group most representative of faecal
contamination of drinking-water. Escherichia coli and other coliforms are mostly non-
pathogenic, plentiful in the enteric tract of humans and animals (about a billion cells
per gram of faeces) and easily cultured in the laboratory. Some coliforms other than
E. coli are also commonly present in the environment. The use of non-pathogenic
laboratory strains of E. coli is recommended for bacterial challenge testing of HWT
technology when pathogen testing is not possible. Escherichia coli B (ATCC 11303) is a
widely available strain and therefore an appropriate choice for this purpose, although

                                          41
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




others are possible as well. Campylobacter jejuni or less pathogenic Campylobacter
species, such as Campylobacter coli, and less pathogenic species of Salmonella can
be used for technology performance evaluation or validation if the laboratory meets
biosafety level II requirements. Enterococcus species, especially E. faecium and E.
faecalis, which are abundant in human faeces and are prevalent and persistent in
faecally contaminated ambient waters, are also suitable candidate surrogates for
pathogenic bacteria in technology performance evaluations. Laboratories performing
microbiological performance testing will need to have experience and capacities
to handle the appropriate bacteria. There are several standardized methods for the
enumeration of E. coli and other bacteria in water (see below).

A2.7.4.1 Method of production and handling procedures
For test bacteria, it is recommended that they be grown overnight (or possibly longer
for some that grow slowly) as pure cultures in non-selective broth media. The use of
selective growth media is generally not recommended, because the bacteria may
become injured or physiologically altered when grown in them. Injured bacteria
respond differently to disinfection processes and other environmental stresses.
Furthermore, bacteria often tend to become injured and physiologically altered when
in water and other environmental media. Starting with bacteria cultures that are
already injured or physiologically altered from inhibitors in their growth medium can
further compromise the physiological state of the cells in unpredictable ways that are
not typical for pathogenic bacteria present in water from human or animal waste and
other sources.
    For many bacteria of interest in water as pathogens or indicators of pathogens,
broth cultures prepared for water technology testing can be used immediately, or they
can be stored refrigerated for use within a given work week. New cultures should
be made weekly. The cells of these broth cultures can be used directly for challenge
studies of some treatment technologies if the cells are at high concentrations (allowing
for considerable dilution into test waters), relatively dispersed and free of excessive
amounts of extraneous solids and dissolved solutes that will interfere with the mode
of action of the treatment technology. However, for many HWT technologies, the
bacteria cells may need to be further puriﬁed to reduce inhibitory materials that would
compromise the testing conditions. Such puriﬁcation is usually done by centrifuging
the cells out of the culture medium at several thousand times gravity for several tens of
minutes and resuspending them either in a medium compatible with the test water or
in the test water itself.
    For physical water treatment processes based on exposure to high temperatures,
such as boiling, thermal pasteurization (e.g. solar disinfection in opaque containers)
or exposure to sunlight (solar disinfection) or UV radiation from lamps, bacteria
cultures can be used directly by adding the cells in their culture medium directly to test
waters. The thermal and UV radiation effects causing bacterial inactivation are likely
to be about the same for cells added to test waters either directly as culture medium or
after further puriﬁcation by washing procedures, as long as there is sufﬁcient dilution
of the culture in the test water to prevent constituents from causing interferences (e.g.
absorbing or blocking UV disinfection treatment). However, for performance testing
of most other HWT technologies, further puriﬁcation of bacteria cells prior to spiking
them into test waters is recommended. This is because undesirable physical states of
the bacteria and impurities in the culture medium can interfere in unpredictable ways
with the evaluation of the HWT technology.

                                                 42
                        EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




    For example, in challenge tests of chlorine or other chemical oxidant disinfection
technologies, washing the test bacteria by centrifuging them out of the culture medium
and resuspending them in either test water or other water having low chlorine demand
is necessary to free the cells from the high chlorine-demanding solutes of the bacterial
culture. Adding bacteria still in their culture medium to test water can introduce high
concentrations of chlorine-demanding solutes that cause the dosed chlorine to be
quickly consumed, resulting in no chlorine residual remaining during the intended
contact time.
    As another example, chemical disinfection, ﬁltration and sedimentation studies are
best done using dispersed cells. Some bacteria can be grown in broth culture media
and remain mostly dispersed (as individual discrete cells) without further treatment. For
such bacteria, further treatment to disperse the cells may not be necessary. However, if
the test bacteria have a tendency to mostly aggregate or clump, it may be necessary
to disperse the cells by physical or chemical treatment. In the case of testing ﬁltration
technologies, the use of dispersed cells is important in order to document that the
pore size distribution of the ﬁlter is small enough to exclude individual cells. If the
cells are aggregated as large clumps, the effective size of the particles is much larger
than the size of the individual (discrete) bacteria cells and therefore not adequately
representative of the performance of the ﬁlter in removing individual (discrete) cells.
Treatments to disperse cells include physical treatments, such as sonication (e.g. in
an ultrasonic bath) or pre-ﬁltration through a membrane ﬁlter that removes bacterial
aggregates but allows passage of non-aggregated (individual or discrete) cells, and
chemical treatments, such as the addition of low concentrations of a surfactant (e.g. a
non-ionic detergent) to the cultured bacteria to disperse the cells.

A2.7.4.2 Methods for enumerating bacteria in spiked samples
Bacteria are usually assayed by either quantal (presence/absence) or enumerative
methods. Quantal assays involve making serial dilutions of a sample, inoculating
multiple cultures for each sample dilution, scoring each of the inoculated cultures as
positive or negative for characteristic bacterial growth and then using the data for
positive and negative cultures of key sample dilutions to estimate bacterial density as
a most probable number (MPN) per unit sample volume. Enumerative culture methods
usually are based on counting bacteria colonies on a solid medium (typically an agar
medium) or a membrane ﬁlter that has received a unit volume of sample. Enumerative
(colony count) methods employing agar media include pour, spread and spot (drop)
plates. A unit volume of the water sample is inoculated either undiluted or after dilution
onto a plate of solidiﬁed agar medium (by spreading over the entire surface of the
agar or by applying individual small volumes to the agar surface as discrete drops or
spots), or it is mixed with molten agar medium and poured into a culture dish to then
solidify. In the membrane ﬁlter method, a volume of the undiluted or diluted sample is
ﬁltered through a microporous membrane ﬁlter that retains bacteria. The membrane
is then placed onto the surface of a plate with growth medium. After incubation for
bacteria to grow and form colonies on agar plates or on membrane ﬁlters of culture
medium plates, the colonies are counted to determine the bacteria concentration as
colony-forming units per unit volume of water.
    A wide range of techniques and methodologies exist for the enumeration of E. coli
in water samples (NRC, 2004), including methods published in Standard methods
for the examination of water and wastewater (Eaton et al., 2005) and methods by
the USEPA (e.g. USEPA, 2002a,b), ASTM International (e.g. ASTM, 2006) and the

                                          43
             Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




International Organization for Standardization (e.g. ISO, 2000), among others. EPA
Methods 1603 and 1604 (USEPA, 2002a,b) and Standard Method 9222 (Eaton
et al., 2005) describe basic membrane ﬁltration techniques for the enumeration of
E. coli in water samples. These methods are recommended for use in quantifying E.
coli samples in spiked untreated and treated water samples.

A2.7.5 Viruses
Viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that must be grown and assayed in living
host cells. Viruses used to evaluate drinking-water treatment technologies can be target
human viral pathogens, viruses of E. coli bacteria (coliphages) or other bacteriophages
that serve as indicator or surrogate viruses. Some taxonomic groups of coliphages
and other bacteriophages resemble human viral pathogens in general size, shape,
composition, environmental persistence and response to water treatment processes.
However, compared with human viral pathogens, they are much easier and safer to
propagate, assay and handle for technology performance evaluation or veriﬁcation
studies. The target human viral pathogens of greatest risk in drinking-water include
hepatitis A and E viruses (causes of infectious hepatitis), rotaviruses and noroviruses
(Norwalk virus and related human caliciviruses or noroviruses). These viruses must
be used in laboratories certiﬁed as biosafety level II. Hence, technology performance
validation testing of HWT processes with these viruses is limited to the few laboratories
regionally that are both certiﬁed as biosafety level II and also knowledgeable
about and proﬁcient in water treatment technology veriﬁcation procedures. In these
laboratories, hepatitis A virus, rotaviruses and caliciviruses can be grown and
assayed in mammalian cell cultures. The viruses can be puriﬁed and seeded into test
waters for treatment technology veriﬁcation studies. Human noroviruses have not been
grown in mammalian cell cultures in the laboratory and therefore are not practical
or convenient for use in water treatment technology veriﬁcation studies. Some non-
human caliciviruses or noroviruses, such as feline calicivirus and murine norovirus, are
surrogates for human noroviruses that can be used for HWT technology evaluation
and veriﬁcation studies. However, using these viruses also requires a biosafety level II
laboratory and appropriately trained and experienced personnel.

A2.7.5.1 Coliphages as surrogates for human viruses in laboratory
testing
Where possible, human viruses can be used in virus challenge testing of HWT
technology. However, these viruses are human pathogens, they are classiﬁed as
biosafety level II agents (or higher) and as such they require specialized equipment,
facilities and training. Therefore, the use of bacteriophages (viruses of bacteria)
as surrogates for human viruses is an acceptable and even preferred alternative,
especially where biosafety level II laboratories and laboratory analysts trained in
biosafety level II procedures are not available. Bacteriophages are widely accepted
and used for water treatment technology validation, including for UV radiation,
ﬁltration and chemical disinfection technologies. Several different viruses of E. coli
(coliphages) and other enteric bacteria are effective, convenient and widely used
for water treatment technology testing. These include the F+RNA coliphages of the
Leviviridae family, such as MS2 and Q-Beta, small deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-
containing coliphages belonging to the Microviridae family, such as űX-174, and
larger DNA-containing bacteriophages of the Tectiviridae family, such as PRD-1.
Critical to the use of these bacteriophages is the availability of appropriate strains of

                                                44
                        EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




E. coli or other host bacteria. These bacterial hosts must be routinely maintained and
tested for their ability to efﬁciently grow and assay the bacteriophages for which they
are a sensitive and speciﬁc host cell. Preferred host cells include E. coli strains F-amp
and K12 for MS2 and Q-Beta, E. coli C for űX-174, and Salmonella typhimurium LT2
(a pathogenic host bacterium) for PRD-1. MS2 and űX-174 are recommended for use
and are further addressed here.
    MS2 is a male-speciﬁc (F+), icosahedral, non-enveloped coliphage with
an isoelectric point (pI) of 3.9. It is often used in modelling enteric viruses, due
to its similarity to poliovirus and hepatitis in size (diameter = 24–25 nm), shape
(icosahedral) and nucleic acid (single-stranded ribonucleic acid [RNA]). It belongs to
the environmentally stable genotype I of the F+RNA coliphages, and its presence in
water has been shown to be strongly associated with enteric viruses in environmental
samples. It is also useful in laboratory applications due to its ease of recovery and
enumeration, non-pathogenic nature and ease of attaining high titres. Human enteric
viruses and F+ coliphages probably do not correlate well in relative numbers at any
given time in the environment due to the varying presence of human enteric virus
pathogens in communities. Coliphages are normally present in faecally contaminated
water, but enteric viruses may be present only periodically, such as during an
outbreak, when the pathogen is being shed by infected people (Grabow, 2001).
űX-174 is a somatic, small (25 nm diameter), spherical virus (pI = 6.6) with DNA as
the nucleic acid. It is also useful as an indicator for enteric viruses in water, owing
to its easy detection and correlation with enteric viruses in water and wastewater
(Grabow, 2001). The electrostatic properties of bacteriophages might differ from
those of the enteric viruses. Therefore, they may not behave identically in terms of
adsorption or association with other particles in water, and inactivation of these
bacteriophages may not be representative of all other viruses. Sobsey et al. (1995)
found, however, that F-speciﬁc (male) coliphages behaved comparably to hepatitis A
virus and the simian rotavirus SA-11 in the bench-scale modelling of drinking-water
treatment processes such as ﬂocculation, coagulation and sedimentation; rapid sand
ﬁltration; and chlorine disinfection. There is also some evidence that MS2 can be
a conservative estimator of other viruses, including poliovirus type 1, in slow sand
ﬁltration (Schijven et al., 2003). MS2 coliphage is a conservative indicator for viral
pathogens in water subjected to UV irradiation treatment, requiring a higher UV
dose to be inactivated relative to other pathogens, including rotavirus, poliovirus and
hepatitis A virus (Jevons, 1982; Wolfe, 1990; Wilson, 1992).

A2.7.5.2 Preparation and puriﬁcation of bacteriophage stocks
Bacteriophages can be grown in their cultured host cells and then recovered and
puriﬁed for use in HWT technology performance evaluation or validation studies.
Bacteriophages can be grown (propagated) by allowing them to infect and replicate
in their host cells in liquid broth enrichment cultures using methods similar to those
for their quantal enrichment assay. Usually, the host bacteria are ﬁrst propagated in
liquid broth culture medium to the log phase of growth. Then, the bacteriophages
are added to the bacteria culture at a ratio of about 1 bacteriophage per 10–1000
cells. The culture is reincubated with constant mixing to allow for several cycles of
bacteriophage infection, replication and host cell lysis (typically 2–5 hours). The
resulting culture is then centrifuged at 1000–5000 times gravity for 15–30 minutes
to sediment the lysed host cell debris, and the supernatant is recovered as crude
bacteriophage stock. Bacteriophages can also be propagated by recovering them

                                          45
              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




from the agar medium of plaque assay plates having conﬂuent (100%) lysis of host
cells. This can be done by scraping the virus-containing agar and lysed host bacteria
material into a small volume of buffered water, mixing this suspension to release the
viruses from the recovered agar medium and lysed host cells, centrifuging at moderate
speed (1000–5000 times gravity for 10–30 minutes) to sediment the agar and host
cell debris, and then recovering the resulting supernatant as crude bacteriophage
stock. Crude bacteriophage stock can be used for technology veriﬁcation of thermal
treatment processes such as boiling or solar disinfection with heat only.
    For use in water treatment technology performance evaluation or validation studies
on technologies such as chemical disinfection, UV disinfection and other chemical
treatments (e.g. coagulation and precipitation), it is recommended that viruses be
further puriﬁed by chloroform or other organic solvent (e.g. ﬂuorocarbon) extraction.
The recovered supernatant virus stocks from either plaque assay or enrichment culture
propagation can be solvent-extracted by adding the solvent (e.g. chloroform or
ﬂuorocarbon) to the supernatant virus stock at a ratio of 1 part solvent to 2–10 parts
virus stock. The mixture is mixed vigorously by hand or with a vortex mixer to create an
emulsion. The emulsion is then centrifuged at 3000–5000 times gravity for 30 minutes
to separate the aqueous virus material from the organic solvent. The resulting aqueous
supernatant containing the virus is recovered by aspirating or decanting, leaving the
organic solvent and any sedimented debris behind.
    For use in evaluating certain ﬁltration technologies for water treatment, it may be
advisable to further purify the virus suspension by removing large aggregates of virus
particles by pre-ﬁltration ﬁltration and recovering the ﬁltrate as relatively dispersed
virus stock. Pre-ﬁltration is usually through low protein binding membrane ﬁlters, such
as those made of polycarbonate or specially treated cellulose esters. Chloroform-
extracted virus can be ﬁltered successively through 1 μm (or 0.45 μm) and then
0.2 μm pore size ﬁlters, and the ﬁltrate can be recovered as dispersed virus stock.
    The various methods for growing and purifying bacteriophage stocks are
summarized in Carlson (2004).

A2.7.5.3 Methods for enumerating bacteriophages in spiked samples
Coliphages are easily grown and assayed in bacterial cultures by standard techniques
that are widely used in general, medical, food and environmental microbiology.
Standard coliphage growth and assay procedures have been developed, evaluated
and certiﬁed by national and international entities (Mooijman et al., 2001, 2005;
USEPA, 2001a,b; Sobsey et al., 2004). These include both quantal and enumerative
assays in which the concentrations of coliphages in water samples are quantiﬁed by
their ability to infect and lyse their host bacteria cells. In the enumerative assays, the
viruses form clear zones of lysis (plaques) in lawns of host bacteria in agar medium
plates. In this method, a volume of water sample is combined with host bacteria and
then combined with molten agar medium. The mixture is poured into a culture plate to
harden and then incubated to allow the bacteria to infect and lyse the host cells in the
agar medium; these zones of lysis, called plaques, are then counted. Bacteriophage
concentration is expressed as plaque-forming units per unit volume of water sample.
This agar layer plaque assay method for bacteriophage enumeration is analogous to
the agar medium colony count methods for enumeration of bacteria.
    In the quantal assay methods, multiple sample volumes are inoculated into separate
liquid cultures of the host bacteria in liquid broth culture medium and incubated to
allow the bacteriophage to infect and lyse the host cells. Enrichment cultures positive

for coliphages are detected by removing a small volume of each culture, placing it as
a spot on a lawn of host bacteria in an agar medium, incubating to allow coliphages
in the spots from enrichment cultures to infect and lyse host cells, and then estimating
coliphage concentration based on which enriched and spotted sample volumes are
positive and negative for lysis as an MPN. This enrichment culture MPN method
for bacteriophage assay superﬁcially resembles the enrichment broth culture MPN
methods for bacteria assay. A more recent modiﬁcation of the procedure to score for
coliphage-positive enrichment cultures is to mix a drop of the enrichment culture with
a drop of detector reagent containing plastic beads coated with antibodies directed
speciﬁcally against the coliphages. The coliphages in the enrichment culture react with
the antibodies on the beads, causing the beads to clump together and form visible
aggregates. This procedure, referred to as particle agglutination, is both simple
(mixing two drops of liquid, the enrichment culture and the detector reagent, together
on a solid surface) and rapid (< 1 minute to detect agglutination or clumping) (Love
& Sobsey, 2007).
    Unlike the biosafety II level requirements for human enteric and other mammalian
viruses, biosafety level I laboratories equipped with relatively basic facilities and
equipment are adequate for working with these bacteriophages. Detailed methods
for the propagation, storage and enumeration of these bacteriophages and their
host cells have been provided by the USEPA in EPA Methods 1601/1602 for the
analysis of F+RNA (male-speciﬁc) and somatic coliphages in water samples (USEPA,
2001a,b). The relevant Standard Methods for these are 9224B, C, D, E and F (Eaton
et al., 2005). These are based on methods described by Adams (1959). Additional
laboratory protocols for handling bacteriophages are available (Carlson, 2004).

A2.7.6 Protozoan parasites
The protozoan parasites often targeted for control in drinking-water are
Cryptosporidium parvum, a zoonotic coccidian protozoan, and C. hominis, a species
more commonly infecting humans. Both of the Cryptosporidium species are relatively
small (3–7 μm in diameter) compared with other important waterborne parasites,
relatively persistent in the environment and relatively resistant to chemical disinfection.
They occur widely in humans and animals worldwide, causing gastrointestinal illness
in healthy people and more severe and life-threatening illness in immunocompromised
people. In some parts of the world, other parasites, such as Giardia intestinalis and
Entamoeba histolytica, may be more appropriate protozoan pathogen targets for
control in drinking-water because they are more prevalent in the population and
more signiﬁcant parasite contributors to community waterborne disease burdens.
Cryptosporidium oocysts or other parasites for drinking-water treatment technology
veriﬁcation studies require a reliable source of the parasites, biosafety level II
laboratory facilities and experienced laboratory staff. In the case of Cryptosporidium
oocysts, the source is usually experimentally infected animal hosts such as newborn
calves that shed high concentrations of the oocysts in their faeces. Producing stocks
of Cryptosporidium oocysts is technically challenging and time-consuming because
of the need for ethical treatment of experimental animals, careful collection of the
animal faecal matter containing the oocysts and puriﬁcation and appropriate storage
of the oocysts. In some more technologically developed countries, Cryptosporidium
oocysts and cysts of some other protozoan parasites, such as Giardia intestinalis (or
the similar murine equivalent, Giardia muris), are commercially available. The costs
of these commercially available protozoa are relatively high, and they require special

                                          47
             Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




handling in shipment if they are still viable and infectious. However, Cryptosporidium
oocysts and Giardia cysts that have been rendered non-viable and also stained with
ﬂuorescent dyes are commercially available. Such non-viable, ﬂuorescent protozoan
parasite cysts and oocysts are useful for performance evaluation of HWT technologies
such as ﬁlters that function by physically removing the microbes.
    For some drinking-water treatment technology performance evaluation or validation
studies in which pathogen reduction is by physical removal, such as ﬁltration,
coagulation–ﬂocculation and settling and sedimentation, the analytical methods to
detect and quantify the parasites in water can be based on direct enumeration by
microscopy. Such microscopic examination usually requires that the parasites in the
water samples be further concentrated and then stained (usually by immunochemical
methods such as ﬂuorescent antibody staining) for subsequent microscopic
enumeration, typically by epiﬂuorescent UV microscopy. This is especially needed
in samples of treated water where the remaining parasite concentrations may be
very low due to their removal by the treatment process. Such ﬂuorescent microscopy
analysis is technically demanding, is time-consuming and requires immunoﬂuorescent
reagents, a high-quality epiﬂuorescent microscope and a trained analyst.
    For drinking-water treatment technologies relying on parasite inactivation by a
physical or chemical disinfection process but not physical removal, such as thermal
treatment, UV irradiation or chlorination, reductions of parasite infectivity are the
basis for evaluating performance. Infectivity assays for parasites based on infecting
an experimental animal or mammalian cell cultures are technically challenging,
require specialized facilities and equipment and are expensive to perform. These
animal or cell culture infectivity assay capabilities may not be available in some
countries or parts of the world. Many parasites can be assayed for “viability” and
changes in viability (due to a treatment process), which are based on exclusion
or uptake of chemical dyes or other vital staining properties. However, it is now
well documented that such viability assays are unreliable predictors of infectivity or
changes in infectivity due to a treatment process. Such viability assays should not be
used to determine protozoan parasite infectivity reductions in drinking-water treatment
technology veriﬁcation studies.
    Where possible and appropriate, Cryptosporidium should be used to challenge
HWT technologies. Because the resources for parasite production and their analyses
by microscopy or infectivity may not be available in some countries or regions of the
world, alternative approaches are needed for drinking-water treatment technology
evaluation of protozoan parasite reductions. A practical and reasonably reliable
alternative to using the parasites themselves is to use a microbial indicator for them.
The most widely used and best documented microbial indicator for protozoan
parasite reduction by water treatment processes is spores of the anaerobic bacterium
Clostridium perfringens or spores of (aerobic) Bacillus spp. Clostridium perfringens
spores are small (about 1 μm in diameter), environmentally stable and persistent,
and relatively resistant to physical and chemical disinfection processes. Clostridium
perfringens can be obtained from reference collections or can be isolated from water,
wastes or soils by culture using differential and selective media and then further
biochemical conﬁrmation. Reference strains of C. perfringens that are known to
be efﬁcient at spore production (sporulation) are preferred over primary isolation
of naturally occurring unknown strains from environmental media. This is because
C. perfringens is generally inefﬁcient at sporulation, and therefore many separate
isolates may need to be screened to identify one that is efﬁcient at producing spores.

                                                48
                        EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




Bacillus spp. spores (e.g. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus atrophaeus) may be harvested from
natural waters, are relatively easy to grow to high titre, are easy to enumerate and
present many of the advantages of C. perfringens with respect to modelling treatment
processes. However, Bacillus spores may germinate under some environmental and
testing conditions, resulting in the formation and growth of vegetative cells. Therefore,
precautions should be taken to maintain Bacillus spore integrity and prevent spore
germination and proliferation of vegetative cells. The potential for spore germination
and vegetative cell growth in the test system should be considered and controlled for,
and challenge test samples should be assayed as soon as possible after collection.
Similar concerns about spore germination and vegetative cell proliferation also apply
to spores of C. perfringens, but the potential for this is less likely than for Bacillus
spores, because C. perfringens is an anaerobe.
    Where the technology’s mechanism for protozoan reduction is physical removal
based on size exclusion, other synthetic surrogate particles may be used. Such particles
may be ﬂuorescent beads of the same size, density and shape as the protozoan (e.g.
Cryptosporidium oocyst) that may be enumerated via a number of methods, such as
ﬂuorescent microscopy.

A2.7.6.1 Clostridium perfringens spores as an indicator for
Cryptosporidium spp. and other protozoa
Clostridium perfringens spores have been suggested as experimental surrogates for
Cryptosporidium oocysts in treatment process and transport modelling, owing to their
resistance to chemical disinfection and environmental stability (Venczel et al., 1997;
Sartory et al., 1998). In ﬁltration processes relying on physical straining, the 1 μm
spores may provide a conservative indicator of the behaviour of the larger (5 μm)
oocysts (Schijven et al., 2003). They may also be the best available surrogate for
Cryptosporidium inactivation by chemical disinfection as a result of their relative
resistance to chlorine inactivation. Venczel et al. (1997) found that C. perfringens was
inactivated by 1.4 log10 over 4 hours compared with no measurable inactivation of
Cryptosporidium oocysts exposed to free chlorine over 4 hours, although inactivation
of the two microbes was similar for a mixed oxidant disinfectant. Payment and
colleagues (Payment et al., 1985; Payment & Franco, 1993) found that C. perfringens
and coliphages correlated well with Cryptosporidium, Giardia and human enteric
viruses in removal by water treatment processes. UV radiation and heat inactivation of
microbes are less effective treatments against bacterial spores than against protozoa
as well as vegetative bacteria and viruses. Therefore, C. perfringens spores may
provide a conservative indicator of the effectiveness of these technologies against
waterborne protozoa such as Cryptosporidium, Giardia and Entamoeba.

Method of production
Clostridium perfringens spores are produced by culturing the bacteria in sporulation
media under conditions that promote spore formation. There are several sporulation
media for propagating C. perfringens spores, but Duncan-Strong medium and
variations of it are widely used and recommended (Duncan & Strong, 1968; Labbe,
Somers & Duncan, 1976; Labbe & Rey, 1979; Hsieh & Labbe, 2007). The resulting
spore crops can be stored refrigerated for extended periods of time (weeks), or they
can be frozen (months to years).

              Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




Analysis for Clostridium perfringens spores
Spores are usually quantiﬁed or enumerated by culture methods in selective and
differential media. To assay only spores and not vegetative cells that might also be
present in samples, the samples are pretreated by heat exposure, typically 70 °C
for 15–30 minutes, before culturing. For quantal assay by broth culture methods
of multiple sample volumes to obtain MPN estimates of concentration, a preferred
culture medium is iron milk, with incubation at 41 °C. In this medium, C. perfringens
growth is detected by “stormy fermentation”, which occurs when the medium clots and
entraps gas bubbles produced by the growing bacteria. Alternatively, C. perfringens
in water samples can be assayed by membrane ﬁlter methods with incubation on
selective media such as mCp as modiﬁed by Armon & Payment (1988) from the
original formulation of Bisson & Cabelli (1979) and tryptose-sulﬁte-cycloserine (TSC)
medium (Sartory et al., 1998; Adcock & Saint, 2001). Recent studies suggest that
TSC medium is equivalent to or better than mCp for enumeration of C. perfringens
(e.g. Araujo et al., 2001).
    ASTM Method D5916-96(2002), Standard Test Method for Detection and
Enumeration of Clostridium perfringens from Water and Extracted Sediments by
Membrane Filtration (MF) (ASTM, 2002), is one commonly used method for quantiﬁcation
of C. perfringens based on membrane ﬁltration and incubation on selective media. The
United Kingdom’s Health Protection Agency (2004) has developed a standard method
for C. perfringens enumeration using incubation on TSC medium.

A2.7.6.2 Bacillus spp. spores as an indicator for Cryptosporidium
and other protozoa
Bacillus spp. spores have been suggested as experimental surrogates for
Cryptosporidium oocysts in treatment process and transport modelling. Bacillus
spp. and other aerobic spore-forming bacteria populations are relatively resistant to
disinfection, are environmentally stable and are also often found in natural waters in
high enough concentrations to be useful in calculating multiple log10 reductions (Dey
et al., 1998; Nieminski, Bellamy & Moss, 2000; Chauret et al., 2001; Verhille et al.,
2003).

Method of production
Bacillus spp. spores are produced by culturing bacteria in sporulation media under
conditions that promote spore formation. There are several sporulation media for
propagating Bacillus spores, but AK Agar #2 (Sporulating Agar) medium is widely
used and recommended. The resulting spore crops can be stored refrigerated for
extended periods of time (weeks), or they can be frozen (months to years) if stored
in 7–10% glycerol at −80 °C. Methods for spore production are fully described in
Dey et al. (1998) and Chauret et al. (2001). A note of caution when using Bacillus
spores for technology performance evaluation is the ability of the spores to germinate
into vegetative cells and reproduce (multiply). The use of these spores in technology
challenge studies where the test conditions may lead to spore germination and
propagation is not recommended. Physical treatment processes that involve biological
activity or in which there are long contact times could lead to Bacillus spore germination
and multiplication of vegetative cells. The use of Bacillus spores should be avoided
where there is a risk of such conditions in the test procedure. In general, Bacillus
spores in test water samples from technology performance studies should be assayed
as soon as possible after the samples are collected to avoid spore germination and

                                                 50

vegetative cell propagation. If the samples must be held prior to assay, they should be
kept cold (preferably 4 °C).

Analysis for Bacillus spp. spores
Spores are usually quantiﬁed or enumerated by culture methods in either non-selective
or selective and differential media. The commonly used non-selective medium is
nutrient agar (plates), but care must be taken to distinguish the Bacillus spores from
other bacteria that will grow on this medium. The addition of bromothymol blue
at 0.005% (weight per volume) concentration into nutrient agar facilitates colony
counting (Francis et al., 2001). To assay only spores and not vegetative cells that
might also be present in samples, the samples are pretreated by heat exposure,
typically 70 °C for 15–30 minutes, before culturing on media at 37 °C for 24 hours.
An accessible membrane ﬁltration–based assay has been developed that allows for
rapid enumeration of Bacillus spp. spores in waters of different types (Francis et al.,
2001).

A2.8 Effectiveness of HWT technologies

Estimated reductions of waterborne bacteria, viruses and protozoan parasites by
several of the above-mentioned HWT technologies are summarized in Table A2.4.
The table has been extracted from the fourth edition of the GDWQ (WHO, 2011).
Reductions are based on the results of studies reported in the scientiﬁc literature.
Two categories of effectiveness are reported: baseline reductions and maximum
reductions. Baseline reductions are those typically expected in actual ﬁeld practice
when done by relatively unskilled persons who apply the treatment to raw waters of
average and varying quality and where there are minimum facilities or supporting
instruments to optimize treatment conditions and practices. Maximum reductions are
those possible when treatment is optimized by skilled operators who are supported
with instrumentation and other tools to maintain the highest level of performance in
waters of predictable and unchanging quality (e.g. a test water seeded with known
concentrations of speciﬁc microbes).

APPENDIX 3. ADDITIONAL FACTORS TO CONSIDER
IN NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY
VERIFICATION PROGRAMMES
The extent to which a water treatment process reduces microbial pathogens is critically
important in determining how useful it will be in reducing the risks of waterborne
disease and providing safe water. Because of the diversity of microbial pathogens and
their properties, it is especially important to understand and quantify the effectiveness
of individual HWT technologies in reducing all classes of pathogens in waters of
diverse quality. Recent experiences highlight the importance of this. For example,
the widely used disinfection technology of chlorination was found to be ineffective
in reducing the infectivity of a previously overlooked but widespread waterborne
protozoan parasite, Cryptosporidium, in the 1990s. In part because of such
experiences, there are now strict guidelines, performance standards and protocols
for validation of pathogen reductions by drinking-water treatment processes in the
technologically more developed world (USEPA, 1987; NSF, 2003). These are not,
however, the only relevant considerations in evaluating technologies for local use. A
wide range of additional factors not related to laboratory-demonstrated effectiveness
against microbial pathogens may be locally important in technology veriﬁcation as
well. The following is an overview of additional factors that may be considered in
local technology veriﬁcation programmes, although there are many others. Technology
veriﬁcation should respond to local needs and resources to ensure the protection of
public health and the responsible use of local resources.

A3.1 Field microbiological performance

Microbial effectiveness of HWT technologies is often observed to be reduced under
ﬁeld use conditions compared with laboratory challenge studies (Baumgartner,
2006; Brown, Sobsey & Loomis, 2008; Brown & Sobsey, 2010). This observation
highlights the need to both replicate actual use conditions as closely as possible
when performing laboratory testing and track continued performance of technologies
after their laboratory performance characterization and during actual ﬁeld use. The
differences in performance may be a consequence of user behaviour, caused by
aspects of the technology itself or associated with household environmental conditions
(i.e. hygienic conditions). Household use data can play an important role in technology
veriﬁcation programmes by providing an in situ measure of the intervention’s potential
for improving and protecting water quality. Speciﬁc indicators to measure ﬁeld
microbiological performance are outside the scope of this document but should be
considered carefully in concert with HWT stakeholders in order to provide a realistic
assessment of technology effectiveness.

A3.2 Health impact

There is a recognized need to incorporate outcomes of epidemiological studies in
evaluating the effectiveness of household-based water quality interventions. Some
stakeholders consider this to be essential information for their policy decisions on
selection and implementation of household and other small-scale technologies. While

                                                54
                        EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




a substantial evidence base for health impacts of water quality improvements has
been established for some water treatment technologies, more and better quality
studies are needed. Novel or unproven technologies should, in addition to extensive
laboratory testing for effectiveness in reducing waterborne pathogens, be subjected
to ﬁeld testing, speciﬁcally for the reduction of infectious diseases associated with
drinking-water. There is a clear need for additional controlled trials of small-scale
water treatment devices or methods that are rigorous, long-term, randomized and
blinded.
    When diarrhoeal disease burdens are high, measuring health impact may
be more practical and cost-effective than obtaining location-speciﬁc pathogen
occurrence and disease burden data for a detailed QMRA analysis, such as that
suggested in the GDWQ. It is also likely to provide better estimates of waterborne
disease risks than using faecal indicator microbes alone as proxies for waterborne
pathogens in QMRA analysis. This is because studies examining the relationship
between measured microbial indicators in drinking-water and health outcomes may
reveal only limited or inconsistent associations (Moe et al., 1991; Brown, Proum
& Sobsey, 2008) or no apparent association (Jensen et al., 2004). Ideally, health
impact data should complement water quality data from laboratory and ﬁeld studies
that quantify reductions in microbes through use of a speciﬁc technology or method for
water treatment. Carefully collected epidemiological evidence can be an important
consideration in technology selection and local veriﬁcation. Priority should be given to
rigorous study designs, particularly those that are blinded and randomized.

A3.3 Correct, consistent and continuous use

A number of studies of household water treatment have measured long-term use of
water quality interventions (Luby et al., 2001; Parker et al., 2006; Brown, Sobsey
& Proum, 2007; Arnold et al., 2009; Mäusezhal et al., 2009; Jain et al., 2010).
Existing evidence suggests that declines in use of water treatment devices or practices
may occur after implementation programmes or pilot studies are over and that such
declines are linked to a broad range of factors. Technologies with a high user burden,
with recurrent costs or that involve substantial behaviour change may be especially
susceptible to appreciable declines in use after introduction of the technology.
Extended ﬁeld studies and data on economic and consumer preferences may be
needed to know whether the technologies can be viable long-term options for HWT.
Post-implementation assessments are a critical feedback mechanism to identify and
address challenges faced by small-scale water treatment devices in ﬁeld use.

A3.4 Safe storage

Ideally, HWT methods or technologies can also safeguard against contamination
of water stored in the home through unsafe water handling practices, known to be
a major cause of degraded drinking-water quality. For this reason, safe storage is
an important aspect of some technologies used for drinking-water treatment, or safe
storage containers may be used as a stand-alone technology for protecting water
quality where the main source of contamination is improper handling. Devices that
store water safely prevent users from dipping hands or other potentially contaminated
objects into the water container, acts that may introduce disease-causing microbes.

                                          55
             Health-based targets and microbiological performance specifications




Safe storage containers thus usually have a narrow mouth (so that water is obtained
by pouring, not dipping) or a tap that dispenses the stored water into a cup for
drinking. Technologies using disinfection may be designed to maintain a disinfectant
residual to protect against recontamination. Veriﬁcation programmes may choose to
include the safe storage element in laboratory technology testing.

A3.5 Chemical contaminants and toxicity

The greatest risks of waterborne disease globally are from microbial pathogens (Prüss
et al., 2002), although chemical contaminants are locally or regionally signiﬁcant
risks to public health. These guidelines do not address the potential problem of
anthropogenic or naturally occurring radiological or chemical contaminants that
may be present in drinking-water, including, but not limited to, pesticides, arsenic,
ﬂuoride, heavy metals, nitrate, excess salts, disinfection by-products, pharmaceuticals
and others (Thompson et al., 2007). However, national technology veriﬁcation
programmes may choose to develop and implement effectiveness testing protocols
where HWT is proposed as a solution to chemical contamination of water.
    Alternatively, there have been concerns that technologies may leach chemical
contaminants during use, especially ﬁlters that use raw materials with potentially high
concentrations of arsenic, technologies using photodegradable plastic compounds,
technologies incorporating silver and/or iodine as disinfectants or technologies
using post-consumer recycled materials. If this is suspected, testing of leachate is
recommended to ensure that treated water does not pose additional risks to users.
Recommended limits on chemical contaminants in drinking-water are indicated in
the GDWQ (WHO, 2011). Technologies that use metal-based (e.g. copper, silver,
iodine, bromine) or other novel chemical disinfectants that are potentially toxic at
concentrations in water above WHO guideline values should be subjected to testing
for their concentrations in treated water according to standard methods to ensure that
the chemical quality of the treated water is within acceptable limits.

A3.6 Acceptability of existing published or unpublished
performance data or other evidence

Many HWT technologies are now supported by published and unpublished studies
demonstrating microbiological performance and/or providing data regarding health
impacts, cost-effectiveness, sustainability in long-term use or other factors. In some
cases, these technologies may have demonstrated acceptable performance according
to other evaluation programmes. Technology performance evaluation or veriﬁcation
programmes will need to determine whether and under what conditions existing
evidence may be used to meet performance requirements for national veriﬁcation,
certiﬁcation or product labelling.

A3.7 Other factors that may be considered important in
environmental technology veriﬁcation programmes

A number of other factors can help form the basis for technology selection or local/
national approval. Some of these have been proposed or used in technology selection

factors include the following:

APPENDIX 4. BASIS FOR USE OF QMRA
Obtaining reliable data on the prevalence of diarrhoeal disease from countries and
attributing a percentage of the disease burden to ingesting unsafe drinking-water
are challenging and in many instances impossible. The reasons for this are many
and detailed elsewhere but, in short, include the multiple transmission pathways of
intestinal pathogens, a lack of proper recording and reporting of disease by health
authorities, heterogeneities in disease prevalence among districts/provinces and those
sick not seeking care at health facilities (WHO, 2009). Furthermore, few existing
epidemiological research studies have been designed to estimate the real incidence
of acute diarrhoeal disease (the dominating disease burden arising from ingestion of
unsafe water) in a population (WHO, 2009).
    Epidemiological studies on the health impacts of HWT play an important contributing
role in informing evaluations of HWT technology performance. Yet relying solely on
existing studies to assess the efﬁcacy of HWT technology performance is problematic.
Epidemiological studies on HWT typically assesses water quality through use of faecal
indicators. Unfortunately, as described in Appendix 3, current evidence does not
demonstrate a ﬁxed relationship between indicators of microbial water quality and
pathogens. The functional objective of HWT methods is to reduce pathogens, and thus
determination of pathogen removal is an essential, direct measure of performance.
Because epidemiological studies typically do not measure pathogen concentrations
before and after treatment, it is difﬁcult to attribute pathogen reduction to health effects
and consequently to set pathogen performance targets.
    It is now increasingly recognized that drawing conclusions from the current
epidemiological evidence base addressing HWT, especially for developing countries,
is premature. Great heterogeneities exist among studies, making it difﬁcult to draw
conclusions across regions, and the effect of the health beneﬁts associated with HWT
may be exaggerated due to the lack of blinded trials and a decline in health impact
(e.g. magnitude of diarrhoeal disease reduction) over time (Hunter, 2009; Schmidt
& Cairncross, 2009). Many HWT intervention studies have demonstrated signiﬁcant
diarrhoeal disease reductions (e.g. 20–40%), despite the different capabilities of
the HWT technologies to reduce common waterborne pathogens, and despite being
inconsistently applied or practised (e.g. no residual chlorine found, or observations
of householders regularly drinking untreated water). Therefore, making quantitative
estimates of impact and drawing conclusions on acceptable performance of HWT
technologies by only relying on epidemiological studies would be imprudent.
Furthermore, longer-term HWT epidemiological studies have not convincingly
demonstrated reductions in diarrhoeal disease, suggesting that there are many
factors inﬂuencing their results beyond whether or not a technology “works”. These
include acceptability, consistent use and varying sources and pathways of faecal–oral
contamination (Arnold et al., 2009; Mäusezhal et al., 2009; Boissone et al., 2010).
    QMRA, through its application of pathogen-speciﬁc dose–response information,
provides a direct method of linking reductions in waterborne pathogens as a result
of water treatment to health impacts. It is an increasingly common method for
assessing the microbial safety of drinking-water. The framework is being applied in
the development of risk-based drinking-water standards in Australia, the European
Union (MICRORISK) and the Netherlands, among other places.
    QMRA is not without limitations, and the mathematical models on which it is
based rely on several assumptions. First, the dose–response values are derived from

                                                 58
                        EVALUATING HOUSEHOLD WATER TREATMENT OPTIONS:




studies on human volunteers who may differ in immunity and health status from those
populations to which the method is applied. Second, the assumptions for background
water quality can be questioned. Third, QMRA is essentially a mathematical model,
with the high level of uncertainties inherent in predictive modelling.
    QMRA is complementary to epidemiological approaches. If robust epidemiological
data indicate health beneﬁts from HWT devices and the HWT devices meet
the “protective” target for two pathogen classes, then such HWT devices can be
recommended. As the amount of robust epidemiological evidence increases, especially
from randomized, controlled, blinded HWT trials over longer periods of intervention
time, such data will play a larger role in evaluating the efﬁcacy and effectiveness of
HWT technologies. This is especially true given that the HWT performance guidance
is not prescriptive, but rather meant to provide a framework from which national
guidelines and regulations can be developed in the context of local conditions and
evidence.
    The HWT health-based performance requirements pertain to three pathogen
classes (viruses, bacteria and protozoa). Epidemiological evidence and population
and environmental trends suggest that the occurrence of different types of waterborne
pathogens is varied and in many cases difﬁcult to predict or reliably measure.
Globally, water-related pathogens that have emerged or re-emerged recently include
bacteria (e.g. Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp.,
Legionella spp. and pathogenic Escherichia coli), protozoa (e.g. Cryptosporidium
parvum, C. hominis, Giardia intestinalis and Entamoeba histolytica), helminths (e.g.
Ascaris lumbricoides), viruses (noroviruses, rotaviruses, hepatitis A and E viruses and
adenoviruses) and fungi (UNEP/GEMS, 2008). The temporal and spatial variations
in pathogen concentrations suggest the need to reduce all three major classes for
which there is clear evidence of waterborne disease: bacteria, parasites and viruses.
Selected ﬁeld studies illustrate the importance of protecting against all three types of
pathogens, especially in the absence of timely, seasonal, local data. For example,
the global enteric multi-centre study taking place in seven developing countries has
isolated all three classes of pathogens in children under ﬁve years of age (Levin,
2009). Elsewhere, a recent childhood diarrhoeal study in Yaoundé, Cameroon,
found that of those cases of infectious diarrhoea, 59.2% were caused by pathogenic
parasites, 36.9% by pathogenic bacteria and 3.8% by pathogenic viruses (Yongsi,
2008). An etiological study of diarrhoea in Tanzania, however, found that in the
dry season, pathogenic bacteria (37.4%) followed by pathogenic viruses (23.6%)
dominated as causes of disease in children, whereas in the rainy season, protozoa
became more prevalent and viruses diminished in importance (Vargas et al., 2004).
Other studies indicate, in developing countries, the asymptomatic faecal shedding of
intestinal protozoan pathogens, complicating and sometimes compromising a purely
epidemiological approach based on assessing only cases of diarrhoea (Checkley
et al., 1997; Esteban et al., 1998; Ramos et al., 2005; Wongstitwilairoong et al.,
2007). The relative importance of each pathogen class may be locally variable.
However, in the absence of strong evidence to negate the use of all three and given the
global nature of this document, the most prudent approach is to base the performance
targets on removal of bacteria, viruses and protozoa.

      Evaluating household water treatment options: Health-based targets and
                    microbiological performance speciﬁcations

Household water treatment (HWT) is increasingly being promoted as a rapidly
implementable and cost-effective interim approach to improve water quality. It is a key
preventive component of the WHO/UNICEF comprehensive strategy on diarrhoea
control.

This document, for the ﬁrst time, sets forth global criteria that enable users to evaluate
whether an HWT option reduces waterborne pathogens sufﬁciently to protect health.
Through use of a risk-based framework and by emphasizing the philosophy of
incremental improvement, it is intended to provide implementers and policy-makers
with an evidence-based and pragmatic approach to select options suited to local
conditions.

The document provides a range of technical recommendations, including:
s a step-by-step overview of how to evaluate HWT microbiological performance;
s elaboration of health-based water quality targets ranging from interim to highly
   protective, including establishment of default targets for use in data-scarce settings;
s description of technology-speciﬁc laboratory testing protocols and guiding
   principles;
s considerations relating to developing national technology evaluation programmes.

This document is especially intended for resource-scarce settings where water quality
laboratories may have limited capacity and incremental improvements of HWT
performance could have a substantial, positive impact on public health.
