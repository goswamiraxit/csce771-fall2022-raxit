                                           Note to the Reader

        The Water Quality Standards Handbook, first issued in 1983, is a compilation of EPA's
guidance on the water quality standards program and provides direction for States in reviewing,
revising and implementing water quality standards. The Waler Quality Standards Handbook·
Second Edition retains all the guidance in the 1983 Handbook unless such guidance was specitically
revised in subsequent years. An annotated list of the major guidance and policy documents on the
water quality standards program issued since 1983 is included in the Introduction and material added
to the Second Edition by periodic updates since 1993 is summarized in Appendix X. Material in the
Handbook contains only guidance previously issued by EPA; it contains no new guidance.

        The guidance contained in each of the documents listed in the Introduction is either:
I) incorporated in its entirety, or summarized, in the text of the appropriate section of this
Handbook, or 2) attached as an appendix (see Table of Contents). If there is uncertainty or
perceived inconsistency on any of the guidance incorporated into this Handbook, the reader is
directed to review the original guidance documents or call the Water Quality Standards Branch at
(202) 260-1315. Copies of all original guidance documents not attached as appendices may be
obtained from the source listed for each document in the Reference section of this Handbook.

                                             GWSSARY


The "Act" refers to the Clean Water Act (Public Law 92-500, as amended (33 USC 1251,           ~.)     (40
      CFR 131.3.)

"Acute" refers to a stimulus severe enough to rapidly induce an effect; in aquatic toxicity tests, an
      effect observed in 96- hours or less is typically considered acute. When referring to aquatic
      toxicology or human health, an acute affect is not always measured in terms of lethality
      (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Acute-chronic ratio" (ACR) is the ratio of the acute toxicity of an effluent or a toxicant to its chronic
      toxicity. It is used as a factor for estimating chronic toxicity on the basis of acute toxicity data,
      or for estimating acute toxicity on the basis of chronic toxicity data (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Acutely toxic conditions" are those acutely toxic to aquatic organisms following their short-term
      exposure within an affected area (USEPA , 1991a.)

"Additivity" is the characteristic property of a mixture of toxicants that exhibits a total toxic effect
      equal to the arithmetic sum of the effects of the individual toxicants (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Ambient toxicity" is measured by a toxicity test on a sample collected from a water body (USEPA,
     1991a.)

"Antagonism" is the characteristic property of a mixture of toxicants that exhibits a less-than-additive
      total toxic effect (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Aquatic community" is an association of interacting populations of aquatic organisms in a given water
      body or habitat (USEPA, 1990; USEPA , 1991a.)

"Averaging period" is the period of time over which the receiving water concentration is averaged for
      comparison with criteria concentrations. This specification limits the duration of concentrations
      above the criteria (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Bioaccumulation" is the process by which a compound is taken up oy an aquatic organism, both from
      water and through food (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Bioaccumulation factor" (BAY) is the ratio of a substance's concentration in tissue versus its
      concentration in ambient water, in situations where the organism and the food chain are exposed
      (USEPA, 199Ia.)

"Bioassay" is a test used to evaluate the relative potency of a chemical or a mixture of chemicals by
      comparing its effect on a living organism with the effect of a standard preparation on the same
       type of organism. Bioassays are frequently used in the pharmaceutical industry to evaluate the
       potency of vitamins and drugs (USEPA, 1991a.)

Water Quality Standards Handbook - Second Edition


"Bioavailability" is a measure of the physicochemical access that a toxicant has to the biological
      processes of an organism. The less the bioavailability of a toxicant, the less its toxic effect on
      an organism (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Bioconcentration" is the process by which a compound is absorbed from water through gills or
      epithelial tissues and is concentrated in the body (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Bioconcentration factor" (RCF) is the ratio of a substance's concentration in tissue versus its
      concentration in water, in situations where the food chain is DQt exposed or contaminated. For
      non-metabolized substances, it represents equilibrium partitioning between water and organisms
      (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Biological criteria" are narrative expressions or numeric values of the biological characteristics of
       aquatic communities based on appropriate reference conditions. As such, biological criteria serve
       as an index of aquatic community health. It is also known as biocriteria (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Biological integrity" is the condition of the aquatic community inhabiting unimpaired water bodies of
       a specified habitat as measured by community structure and function (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Biological monitoring" describes the use of living organisms in water quality surveillance to indicate
       compliance with water quality standards or effluent limits and to document water quality trends.
       Methods of biological monitoring may include, but are not limited to, toxicity testing (such as
       ambient toxicity testing or whole-effluent toxicity testing) and biological surveys. It is also
       known as biomonitoring (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Biological surveyor biosurvey" is collecting, processing, and analyzing a representative portion of
       the resident aquatic community to determine its structural and/or functional characteristics
       (USFPA. 1991a.)

"Biomagnification" is the process by which the concentration of a compound increases in species
     occupying successive trophic levels (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Cancer potency slope factor" (qt-) is an indication of a chemical's human cancer-eausing potential
      derived using animal studies or epidemiological data on human exposure; based on extrapolation
      of high-dose levels over short periods of time to low-dose levels and a lifetime exposure period
      through the use of a linear model (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Chronic" defines a stimulus that lingers or continues for a relatively long period of time, often 000-
      tenth of the life span or more. Chronic should be considered a relative term depending on the
      life span of an organism. The measurement of a chronic effect can be reduced growth, reduced
      reproduction, etc., in addition to lethality (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Community component" is a general term that may pertain to the biotic guild (fish, invertebrates,
     algae), the taxonomic category (order, family, genus, species), the feeding strategy (herbivore,
     omnivore, predator), or the organizational level (individual, population, assemblage) of a
     biological entity within the aquatic community (USEPA, 1991a.)

                                                                                                    Glossary

"Completely mixed condition" is defined as no measurable difference in the concentration of a
     pollutant exists across a transect of the water body (e.g., does not vary by 5 %) (USEPA.
     1991a.)

"Criteria" are elements of State water quality standards, expressed as constituent concentrations, levels.
       or narrative statements, representing a quality of water that supports a particular use. When
       criteria are met, water quality will generally protect the designated use (40 CFR 131.3.)

"Criteria continuous concentration" (CCe) is the EPA national water quality criteria recommendation
       for the highest instream concentration of a toxicant or an effluent to which organisms can be
       exposed indefinitely without causing unacceptable effect (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Criteria maximum concentration" (CMC) is the EPA national water quality criteria recommendation
       for the highest instream concentration of a toxicant or an effluent to which organisms can be
       exposed for a brief period of time without causing an acute effect (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Critical life stage" is the period of time in an organism's lifespan in which it is the most susceptible
       to adverse effects caused by exposure to toxicants, usually during early development (egg,
       embryo, larvae). Chronic toxicity tests are often run on critical life stages to replace long
       duration, life cycle tests since the most toxic effect usually occurs during the critical life stage
       (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Critical species" is a species that is commercially or recreationally important at the site, a species that
       exists at the site and is listed as threatened or endangered under section 4 of the Endangered
       Species Act, or a species for which there is evidence that the loss of the species from the site
       is likely to cause an unacceptable impact on a commercially or recreationally important species,
       a threatened or endangered species, the abundances of a variety of other species, or the structure
       or function of the community (USEPA, 1994a.)

"Design flow" is the flow used for steady-state waste load allocation modeling (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Designated uses" are those uses specified in water quality standards for each water body or segment
      whether or not they are being attained (40 CFR 131.3.)

"Discharge length scale" is the square root of the cross-sectional area of any discharge outlet (USEPA,
      1991a.)

"Diversity" is the number and abundance of biological taxa in a specified location (USEPA. 1991a.)

"Effective concentration" (Ee) is a point estimate of the toxicant concentration that would cause an
       observable adverse effect (such as death, immobilization, or serious incapacitation) in a given
       percentage of the test organisms (USEPA, 1991a.)

"Existing uses" are those uses actually attained in the water body on or after November 28, 1975,
       whether or not they are included in the water quality standards (40 CFR 131. 3.)

EPA,      in devising guidance for section
303(c)(2)(B), attempted to provide States with the
maximum flexibility that complied with the
express statutory language but also with the
overriding congressional objective: prompt
adoption and implementation of numeric toxics
criteria.   EPA believed that flexibility was
important so that each State could comply with
section 303(c)(2)(B) and to the extent possible,
accommodate its existing water quality standards
regulatory approach. The options EPA identified
are described in section 3.4.1 of this Handbook.

EPA's December 1988 guidance also addressed
the timing issue for State compliance with section
303(c)(2)(B). The statutory directive was clear:
all State standards triennial reviews initiated after
passage of the Act must include a consideration of
numeric toxic criteria.

States significantly responded to the 1987
requirement for numeric criteria for toxic
pollutants. For example, in 1986 on average,
each State had 10 numeric criteria for freshwater
aquatic life. By February 1990, the average
number of freshwater aquatic life criteria was
increased to 30.      Also, States averaged 36
numeric criteria for human health in February
1990. However, by September 1990, many States
had failed to fully satisfy the requirements of
section 303(c)(2)(B).

The addition of section 303(c)(2)(B) to the Clean
Water Act was an unequivocal signal to the States
that Congress wanted toxics criteria in the State's
water quality standards. EPA. consistent with
this mandate, initiated Federal promulgation of
toxic criteria for those States that had not
complied with the Act. EPA proposed Federal
criteria for toxic pollutants for 22 States and
Territories, based on a preliminary assessment of
compliance, on November 19, 1991 (56 F.R.
58420), and promulgated toxic criteria for 14 of
those States on December 22, 1992 (57 F.R.
60848).

Revisions to State water quality standards that
meet the requirements of the Act and the WQS
Regulation are approved by the appropriate EPA
Regional Administrator. If only a partial approval
is made, the Region, in notifying the State,
identifies the portions which should be revised
(e.g., segment-specific requirements).

If the Regional Administrator determines that the
revisions submitted are not consistent with or do
not meet the requirements of the Act or the WQS
Regulation,     the     Regional    Administrator
disapproves the standards within 90 days with a
written notification to the State.      The letter
notifies the State that the Administrator will
initiate promulgation proceedings if the State fails
to adopt and submit the necessary revisions within
90 days after notification. The State water quality
standard remains in effect, even though
disapproved by EPA, until the State revises it or
EPA promulgates a rule that supersedes the State
water quality standard.

Water Quality Standards Handbook - Second Edition

Where NPDES permits exist, the downstream
jurisdiction and the Region should determine if
total maximum daily loads or waste load
allocations will be needed. Where this burden
falls on the Tribe, EPA may need to assist the
Tribe in these assessments or perform the
necessary modeling for the Tribe. The Region
also should assess the scope of any section 401
procedures needed in future NPDES pennit
renewals. The interstate nature of tribal water
quality standards may become important to EPA
because of the recent Arkansas v. Oklahoma U. S.
Supreme Court case (112 section 1046, February
26, 1992), especially when EPA is the permit
writing authority.

              controls; and

            - methods for developing and implementing biological criteria.


     •      How these methods will be integrated in the State's toxics control program (i.e., how the
            State will proceed when the specified methods produce conflicting or inconsistent results).


     •      Application criteria and information needed to apply numerical criteria, for example:

            - methods the State will use to identify those pollutants to be regulated in a specific

            - methods for selecting appropriate hardness, pH, and temperature variables for criteria
              expressed as functions;

            - methods or policies controlling the size and in-zone quality of mixing zones;

            - design flows to be used in translating chemical-specific numeric criteria for aquatic life
              and human health into permit limits; and

To derive the criterion maximum concentration
divide the site-specific Final Acute Value by two.
The site-specific Final Chronic Value can be
obtained as described in the Appendix L. The

described in the recalculation procedure -

specific criterion continuous concentration unless
plant or other data (including data obtained from
the site-specific tests) indicates a lower value is
appropriate. If a problem is identified, judgment
should be used in establishing the site-specific
criterion.

The frequency of testing (e.g., the need for
seasonal testing) will be related to the variability
of the physical and chemical characteristics of site
water as it is expected to affect the biological
availability and/or toxicity of the material of
interest.    As the variability increases, the
frequency of testing will increase. Many of the
limitations discussed for the previous two
procedures would also apply to this procedure.

nonpoint source programs are enforced under
State law and to the extent provided by State law.

Once control measures have been implemented,
the impaired waters should be assessed to
determine if water quality standards have been
attained or are no longer threatened.         The
monitoring program used to gather the data for
this assessment should be designed based on the
specific poJlution problems or sources.       For
example, it is difficult to ensure, a priori, that
implementing nonpoint source controls will
achieve expected load reductions due to
inadequate selection of practices or measures,
inadequate design or implementation, or lack of
fuJI participation by all contributing nonpoint
sources (USEPA, 1987e). As a result, long-term
monitoring efforts must be consistent over time to
develop a data base adequate for analysis of
control actions.


           Measure Progress

If the water body achieves the applicable State
water quality standards, the water body may be
removed from the 303(d) list of waters still
needing TMDLs. If the water quality standards
are not met, the TMDL and allocations of load
and waste loads must be modified.            This
modification should be based on the additional
data and information gathered as required by the
phased approach for developing a TMDL, where
appropriate; as part of routine monitoring
