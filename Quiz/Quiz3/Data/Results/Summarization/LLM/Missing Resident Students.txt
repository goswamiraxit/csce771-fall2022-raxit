 University policy states that when a resident student is missing, reports should be made immediately to any Residence Life staff member or directly to DLES . DLES will dispatch an officer to the studentâ€™s on-campus address to determine whether he/she needs emergency assistance . Parents or legal guardians of a student who are unable to contact their child and, who believe that the student may be in danger or have suffered a medical debilitating condition may contact DLES. The parent or legal guardian will be informed of the student's status subject to any limitations under federal or state law .
