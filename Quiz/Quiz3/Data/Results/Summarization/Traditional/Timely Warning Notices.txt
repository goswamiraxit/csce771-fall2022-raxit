A number of factors are considered to determine if there is an ongoing threat to the University Community that would make it necessary to issue a timely warning. Additionally, warnings or advisories affecting the University Community will be posted on the DLES web site on the crime alert page: http://bit. The DLES Associate Vice President-Chief of Police or his/her designee will be responsible for authorizing and issuing timely warnings, on behalf of the University.
