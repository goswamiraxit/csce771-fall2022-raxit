Alcohol And Drug Policies and Programs To Prevent Alcohol and Drug Abuse
  The University of South Carolina treats the abuse of drugs and alcohol as a serious concern. Finally, the Universityâ€™s Student Care and Outreach Team will notify a parent or guardian of a student under the age of 21 where the consumption of alcohol has resulted in the hospitalization of the student. The Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES) works closely with the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (OSC) and SAPE to educate the student population concerning the responsible use of alcohol.
