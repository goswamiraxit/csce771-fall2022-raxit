Annual Security and Fire Safety Report


Each year, the University of South Carolina compiles and provides the Annual Security
and Fire Safety Report to current and future members of the Carolina Community. The
Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES) performs this task in compliance with
the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act,
referred to as the “Clery Act”, and also in accordance with the Division’s mission to create a
safe and peaceful environment for all students, faculty, staff and visitors of the University of
South Carolina.



The Report
The University of South Carolina, Columbia Campus’ Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is compiled by the Division of Law Enforce-
ment and Safety (DLES). The Division takes great pride in protecting and serving the Carolina Community and is committed to the safety
of all students, faculty, staff, and visitors.

The Division works with departments, units and individuals throughout the University to ensure accurate information and statistics
provided in this report. Information concerning University policies may be found at http://www.sc.edu/policies.

The information in this report was prepared by the University to make current and prospective students as well as employees aware of key
policies and programs in place at the University that: ensure equitable treatment of all members of the University Community; maintain a
safe campus environment; and make vital information available in the event of an emergency. The Annual Security and Fire Safety Report
is also published in compliance with federal law.

Annual Disclosure of Crime Statistics and Preparing the Report
DLES is the primary University office responsible for preparing and distributing the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. This report
is for the Columbia Campus; each campus is responsible for compiling and disclosing their individual reports. To compile information for
the Annual Security Report, University offices collaborate with each other and external agencies, including local law enforcement agencies.
Crimes that are reported in a specific area in and around University Property are collected from collaborating agencies for statistics that are
disclosed to the United States Department of Education.

Federal law mandates that the University publishes and discloses this Report by the first of October each year. This law is called the Jeanne
Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. Also referred to as the Clery Act, it was signed into law as
part of the Crime Awareness and Campus Security Act of 1990.

The Division of Law
Enforcement and Safety
About the Division
The University of South Carolina Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES) is the primary law enforcement agency responsible for
the safety of the University’s Columbia Campus. DLES is operated and sustained by professionals in law enforcement, compliance and
professional standards, environmental health and safety, and risk management. DLES works diligently to protect the people and property
of the University of South Carolina and to uphold their values – human life, integrity, excellence and accountability.

The University’s Columbia Campus covers more than 400 acres downtown. If USC Columbia were its own city, it would be the 13th largest
city in the state based on the size of its enrolled students and staff.

DLES is home to over 100 employees, including over 70 sworn police officers. DLES is divided into three bureaus; Operations, Support
Services, and Administration.

The Operations Bureau, the largest and most visible bureau, is responsible for traditional policing functions. Patrol Officers provide a
uniformed presence and respond to calls for service 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Specialized units such as the Bike Patrol team and
Crime Suppression Unit are also a part of this bureau.

The Support Services Bureau oversees the Communications,Technical Operations and Physical Security (TOPS), and Investigations Units.
Communications Unit personnel take calls from 911 and the non-emergency line, dispatch police, monitor video and alarms. The TOPS
Unit install and maintain over 300 security cameras located across all USC campuses. Criminal investigators are responsible for investigat-
ing crimes.

The Administration Bureau is responsible for the training of DLES personnel, maintaining vital records, and evidence control. This Bureau
is also home to the Emergency Management Unit, which plans for and responds to natural and other disasters.




Enforcement Authority and Training
The police officers employed by DLES are appointed and commissioned as State Constables by the Governor of South Carolina, as pro-
vided by South Carolina law. They are empowered to enforce the laws of South Carolina anywhere in the State, as well as arrest individuals
anywhere in the State. DLES officers complete twelve weeks of law enforcement instruction through the South Carolina Criminal Justice
Academy. They receive at least 40 hours of continuing education every year, which exceeds the state’s minimum requirements.




Interagency Cooperation
DLES works cooperatively with other law enforcement agencies in South Carolina to promote the safety and security of the Carolina
Community. With a downtown location covering many city blocks, there is an increased likelihood that a crime occurring in the metro-
politan area of Columbia may occur on campus. The University of South Carolina’s Columbia Campus shares jurisdiction with other law
enforcement agencies, including the City of Columbia Police Department.

DLES maintains working relationships with local and state prosecutors, the court system, coroners’offices, and other investigative entities
to ensure the ongoing safety and integrity of the Carolina Community. There are specific events that may occur on campus, such as the
death of a student, which would require DLES to notify the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED). DLES also participates
in intelligence sharing associations with other area law enforcement agencies. Ongoing collaboration between agencies enables DLES to
gather data, identify crime trends on and around campus, and provides a system for notifying the Office of Student Conduct and Academic
Integrity when off-campus student crimes or policy violations occur.

DLES and other law enforcement agencies enter into Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) for the purpose of best allocating resources
for the protection of the communities the agencies serve. In particular, DLES enters into MOUs with the City of Columbia Police
Department at times when the University leases significant portions of private housing facilities near the University so that the agencies may
document which entity retains primary law enforcement jurisdiction over the leased property.

Reporting Criminal Incidents
and Other Emergencies
Reporting to the Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
All on-campus crimes, suspicious activity, and safety concerns should be reported to DLES as soon as possible.

There are several ways to make a report or contact law enforcement, depending on where you are located and what is occurring.

On-Campus:

Call. If you are experiencing an emergency or someone is badly injured and cannot be easily transported, call 911. For non-emergencies,
call 803-777-4215 to have an officer come gather the information and collect any evidence.

OR

Visit. You may also visit DLES at 1415 Henderson Street, Columbia, South Carolina.



Off-Campus:

Call. If you are the victim or witness to a crime off-campus, dial 9-1-1 and the law enforcement agency responsible for that jurisdiction
will be contacted.

When you contact law enforcement, you will be asked questions about what happened, including:

     •   Your name and telephone number;
     •   The type of incident;
     •   The location of the incident of which you are reporting;
     •   A detailed description of the suspect(s)and his/her location or direction of travel;
     •   A detailed description of any vehicle involved in the incident; and
     •   Any need for medical assistance.



RAVE Guardian App:

The University provides a FREE mobile app, Rave Guardian, to keep students, faculty and staff safer on and off campus. Rave Guardian,
available at , turns any cell phone into a personalized protection network, connecting with University Police during an emergency and
enhancing safety through a virtual network of friends, family and campus law enforcement. Among its features:

     •   Caller profiles: Students, faculty and staff can set up complete profiles in Rave Guardian. By providing information
     about any medical conditions, course schedule, addresses, campus ID photo and other critical data, it is easier for
     campus police to help in an emergency.
     •   Panic Calls: These instantly connect with USC Police or with local 911. If the call is placed to USC Police, Rave
     Guardian automatically delivers the complete caller profile to telecommunications personnel.
     •   Safety networks: Safety timers notifies trusted “guardians” when the user doesn’t make it to a destination and
     deactivates the timer.
     •   Anonymous crime tips: Allows dispatchers to alert the appropriate agency.

 page 11      Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                              Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
Campus Security Authorities
Campus Security Authorities (CSAs) are individuals and organizations associated with the University that must disclose reports of Clery
Crimes to DLES. CSAs include those who have significant responsibility for student activities.

CSAs can take reports of crimes from members of the University Community who may not feel comfortable going directly to law
enforcement, or who may come in contact with a CSA before having a chance to go to law enforcement. An accuser/reporter that reports a
crime to a CSA does not have to prove that they were the victim or witness of a crime. Any report received in good faith (meaning without
malice, and not based on rumor or hearsay) by a CSA must be reported to DLES.

Each year DLES sends a written request for statistical information to the following Campus Security Authorities:

   •   The Vice President for Student Affairs and all CSAs who work for him/her;
   •   The Provost and all CSAs who work for him/her;
   •   The General Counsel and all CSAs who work for him/her;
   •   The Vice President for Human Resources and all CSAs who work for him/her;
   •   The Associate Vice President of Student Affairs and all CSAs who work for him/her;
   •   The Assistant Vice President for Civil Rights and Title IX and all CSAs who work for him/her;
   •   The Athletics’ Director and all CSAs who work for him/her; and
   •   The Director of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity and all CSAs who work for him/her.




Emergency Call Boxes
Over 300 emergency call boxes are located in visible places on the USC Columbia Campus and are constantly monitored. Emergency call
boxes are topped with blue lights and give people on and around campus a fast way to contact DLES in an emergency. To activate, push
the large button on the front of the call box. You will immediately be connected to a DLES dispatcher. If you are unable to communicate,
the dispatcher will send an officer to your location. If you are unable to stop and wait at the first call box you come to, continue moving
after activating the call box. Push the button on the next available call box, and continue activating call boxes as long as you encounter
them. This allows dispatch to know which way you are traveling, so they may send assistance to your area.




Daily Crime Log
DLES provides a daily log of all criminal reports for public inspection, which is available online or request from the DLES Records Unit
located at 1415 Henderson Street, Columbia, South Carolina 29208.The daily crime log may be found at the DLES webpage by selecting
“Reports, Logs, and Bulletins” Daily Crime Log” at https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/law_enforcement_and_safety/index.php.

DLES complies with federal law that prohibits the disclosure of the names of victims when publishing the daily crime log. The daily crime
log includes: the nature, date, time and general location of each crime; and the disposition of the complaint, if known.




                                                                                                                    University of South Carolina
 page 12    Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                     Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence,
Dating Violence, Relationship
Violence and Stalking
All forms of assault, abuse, harassment and violence are not tolerated at the University of South Carolina. There are confidential resources
at the University and in the community to assist victims of interpersonal violence. The University works to educate, inform, and advocate
for the Carolina Community to end sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence.

What is Consent?
The University of South Carolina defines consent as“the clear, knowing, and voluntary, agreement to participate in mutually agreed-upon
acts. Consent can be given by words and/or actions, as long as those words and/or actions create mutually understandable clear permission
regarding willingness to engage in (and the conditions of ) the sexual activity”. It is the responsibility of each party to determine that the
other(s) has consented before engaging in the sexual activity.

The University of South Carolina defines consent as permitting, approving, or agreeing to act under University policy CR 1.00 (Discrim-
ination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct). University policy CR 1.00 is available at https://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/cr100.pdf. For
consent to take place, the following elements must be present:

   •   Both are clear about their intent to engage in sexual activities and their desire to do so is willing.
   •   Both individuals are fully conscious.
   •   Someone who is incapacitated cannot consent.
   •   Neither individual is impaired by drugs or alcohol to the extent they do not know the who, what, when, where, why, or how of the situation.
   •   Coercion, force, or threat of either cancels consent.
   •   Consent to engage in one form of sexual activity does not provide consent to engage in any other form of sexual activity.
   •   Past consent of sexual activities does not imply future consent.
   •   Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not give consent to engage in sexual activity with someone else.
   •   The existence of a prior or current relationship does not, in itself, constitute consent; even in the context of a relationship, there must be real time
       and mutual consent to sexual activity.
   •   Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time, and sexual contact must cease immediately once consent is withdrawn and clearly
       communicated.
   •   Consent cannot be inferred from the absence of a “no”.
   •   Consent cannot be inferred from silence, passivity, or lack of verbal or physical resistance. Consent may not be given by an individual who has not
       reached the legal age of consent under applicable law.

Definitions of Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and
Stalking
To help you better understand the policies outlined in this report, terms used in University Policies on Sexual Assault and Interpersonal
Violence are defined below. Additionally, definitions for similar terms and related statutes from the South Carolina Code of Laws are
provided for reference. Terminology and state law vary from University Policy at times. This creates circumstances where DLES may not be
abletobringcriminalchargesagainstanindividualaccusedofviolatingUniversityPolicy.However,UniversityPolicyoutlinesconsequences
for the accused perpetrator if they are a member of the University Community, as well as protections for the accuser. This process occurs in
the presence or absence of criminal charges.

Interpersonal Violence: acts of relationship violence including domestic
violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and harassment.
Domestic Violence: For purposes of University policy CR 1.00 (Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct) and related
procedures, this term refers to physical violence, threats of violence against another, threats of violence against individuals close to, pets of,
or property belonging to an individual with a connection to a perpetrator as defined by University policy ro state law.

Domestic violence is defined by South Carolina state law, S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-20, as the unlawful causing of “physical harm or injury
to a person’s own household member”or the“offer or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a person’s own household member with
apparent present ability in circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril .”A“household member”includes a spouse, a former
spouse, persons who have a child in common, cohabitants involved during a romantic relationship or those who formerly cohabitated
during a romantic relationship.

Dating Violence: any act of violence or threats of violence committed by a person: 1. who is or has been in a social relationship of
a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant; and 2. where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a
consideration of the following factors: the length of the relationship; the type of relationship; and the frequency of interaction between the
persons involved in the relationship. Dating violence is not a specific criminal violation in South Carolina. However, the state does prohibit
a number of physically violent actions to include Homicide, Manslaughter, and Assault and Battery in multiple degrees, which may be
applicable.

Stalking: A course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person under similar circumstances or with
similar identities to fear for their own safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress. Course of conduct means two
or more instances, including but not limited to; unwelcome acts in which an individual directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by
any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes
with a person’s property. Stalking includes the concept of cyber-stalking, a particular form of stalking in which electronic media such as the
internet, social networks, blogs, cell phones, texts, or other similar devices or forms of contact are used. South Carolina law, S.C. Code Ann.
§ 16-3-1700, also prohibits stalking which is defined as a “pattern of words, whether verbal written, or electronic, or a pattern” of “two
or more acts occurring over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose”that“serves no legitimate purpose and is
intended to cause and does cause a targeted person and would cause a reasonable person in the targeted person’s position to fear”either“(1)
death of the person or a member of his family; (2) assault upon the person or a member of his family; (3) bodily injury to the person or a
member of his family; (4) criminal sexual contact on the person or a member of his family; (5) kidnapping of the person or a member of his
family; or (6) damage to the property of the person or a member of his family”.

Non-Consensual sexual contact (Offensive Touching): the touching of an unwilling or non-consenting person’s intimate
parts such as genitalia, groin, breast, buttocks, mouth, and/or clothes covering them; the touching of an unwilling person with one’s own
intimate parts; or forcing an unwilling person to touch another’s intimate parts. Offensive Touching falls generally within the Clery Crime
Category of “Forcible Fondling”.

Sexual Assault: any form of sexual contact that occurs without consent and/or through the use of force, threat of force, intimidation,
incapacitationorcoercion.SexualAssaultincludesnon-consensualsexualcontact,non-consensualsexualpenetration,incestandstatutory



                                                                                                                         University of South Carolina

rape. State criminal law defines a sexual assault generally as the unwilling, non-consensual penetration of any bodily opening with any
object or body part that is committed by force, threat, intimidation, or through exploitation of another’s mental or physical condition of
which the assailant was aware or should have been aware. State law governing such actions is found in S.C. Code Ann. §16-3-600 and
§16-3-652 to 655.

Criminal Investigation
If survivors or witnesses want to file formal criminal charges against a perpetrator or request a criminal investigation, they can contact
DLES via 9-1-1; activate an Emergency Call Box by pushing the large red button on the front; contact law enforcement through the RAVE
Guardian app; or call (803) 777-4215 for the 24-hour dispatch line. Additionally, a victim may also request assistance from law enforce-
ment if they are at a hospital to receive medical treatment for injuries that happened as the result of a crime.

Once a crime is reported, DLES will send a uniformed officer and/or criminal investigator to the victim. DLES criminal investigators
receive special training in handling sexual assault cases and relationship-based crimes. DLES may, in certain circumstances, request assis-
tance from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), the state’s primary criminal investigative agency.

In most cases, a DLES victim advocate is there to help the survivor in a number of ways, such as explaining the investigative process;
putting them in contact with SAVIP staff; and providing any additional help the victim may have in their time of need.




Rights of Victims
Under South Carolina law, victims have a number of rights, including:

   •   the right to be treated with fairness, respect, and dignity, and to be free from intimidation, harassment, or abuse,
   throughout the criminal and juvenile justice process, and informed of the victim’s constitutional rights, provided by
   statute;
   •   the right to be reasonably informed when the accused or convicted person is arrested, released from custody, or
   has escaped;
   •   the right to be informed of and present at any criminal proceedings which are dispositive of the charges where
   the defendant has the right to be present;
   •   the right to be reasonably informed of and be allowed to submit either a written or oral statement at all hearings
   affecting bond or bail;
   •   the right to be heard at any proceeding involving a post-arrest release decision, a plea, or sentencing;
   •   the right to be reasonably protected from the accused or persons acting on his behalf throughout the criminal
   justice process;
   •   the right to confer with the prosecution, after the crime against the victim has been charged, before the trial or
   before any disposition and informed of the disposition;
   •   the right to have reasonable access after the conclusion of the criminal investigation to all documents relating to

   •   the right to receive prompt and full restitution from the person or persons convicted of the criminal conduct that
   caused the victim’s loss or injury including both adult and juvenile offenders;
   •   the right to be informed of any proceeding when any post-conviction action is being considered, and be present
   at any post-conviction hearing involving a post-conviction release decision;
   •   the right to a reasonable disposition and prompt and final conclusion of the case; and
   •   the right to have all rules governing criminal procedure and the admissibility of evidence in all criminal proceed-
   ings protect victims’ rights and have these rules subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature to ensure protec-
   tion of these rights.




                                                                                                                           University of South Carolina
 page 16      Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                          Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
Beyond these rights, DLES provides additional assistance to crime victims, including:

   •   providing a free copy of incident reports when requested;
   •   providing information about local victim assistance providers;
   •   informing them of how to be compensated by the State Office of Victim Assistance (SOVA) and assistance in
       applying for compensation and other forms of assistance that may be available.


DLES victim advocates are trained in assisting victims and can serve as liaisons for them following a crime. They provide other forms of
support and advocacy that make the criminal justice process less intimidating for victims.

University Administrative Inquiries
Incertaincircumstances,studentsthatengageinconductthatviolatestheUniversity’sstandardsmaybesubjecttotheUniversity’sadminis-
trative process.This process typically involves an investigation, conduct hearing, and potential disciplinary action by the University’s Office
of Civil Rights and Title IX (OCR) and/or Office of Student Conduct (OSC).

A student may file a complaint directly with DLES, (OCR), or OSC. However, in some cases, the process starts when a student seeks help
from University Health Services’ Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention Office (SAVIP). Beyond providing a wide range
of assistance for victims, SAVIP can assist a victim in the process of filing complaints with DLES, OCR, and/or OSC. More information
regarding the assistance SAVIP may offer is provided in this report.




Office of Civil Rights and Title IX
Through the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX (OCR-TIX), students, faculty, and staff may report incidents where members of the
University Community have experienced discrimination and/or harassment based on age, race, ethnicity, sex, gender, religion, national
origin, disability, genetics, or veteran status.

OCR-TIX also handles Title IX complaints. Recently, the United States Department of Education has emphasized that Title IX requires
Universities to include sexual assaults, sexual harassment, sexual violence, and sexual misconduct involving members of the University
Community under their investigative authority. Title IX also prohibits retaliation against an individual who, in good faith, asserts his/her
rights under Title IX or other federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination.

Any student with a complaint of discrimination or discriminatory harassment should contact OCR-TIX. Students can file complaints
against faculty, staff, other students, student organizations, and any entity doing business or associated with the University. If you believe
you have experienced discrimination or harassment based on your status as a protected group, contact OCR-TIX at (803) 777-3854 for
assistance, or submit your information to OCR-TIX using the“Report an Incident”option at https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divi-
sions/civil_rights_title_ix/.

Certain employees and persons associated with the University must contact the OCR-TIX if they receive a report from a student that has
experienced harassment including but not limited to sexual misconduct, sexual violence, sexual assault, or any criminal behavior based on
sex or discrimination.These persons with a duty to report include administrators, supervisors, department chairs, or person in a position
of power over a student. Failure to immediately report any Title IX matter may result in disciplinary action against any person (e.g.,
administrators, faculty or staff members) in a position of power over a student. Students or staff may file a complaint at https://cm.maxient.
com/reporting.php?UnivofSouthCarolina.

Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity
The Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (OSC) is a University department designed to promote individual student
developmentandacampusclimateofcivilityandaccountability.Thisofficeencourageseducationandaccountabilitybyprovidingprocesses



                                                                                                                       University of South Carolina
 page 17     Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                       Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
designed to uphold the behavioral expectations of the University’s Code of Conduct.

OSC reviews a wide range of student violations of the Code of Conduct from alcohol violations to sexual assaults. The investigation and
possible prosecution of a University student in the criminal justice system does not prevent them from also being subject to civil sanctions
imposed by the University. The University holds students to the standards outlined in the Code of Conduct while they are on campus or
any other location for as long as they remain students at the University.

OSC may begin a student conduct investigation upon receiving information that a University student has violated the Code of Conduct.
Typically OSC receives such information from DLES, SAVIP, OCR-TIX, or through a complaint filed by another student. University
students are also required to notify OSC within 72 hours after they have been arrested by a law enforcement agency other than DLES.

A complaint form may be submitted to OSC online at https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_in-
tegrity/make_a_report/. Once a complaint is received, OSC will meet with individuals thought to have relevant information, including
the student who has been accused. OSC will assess the Code of Conduct to determine which charges most closely meet the behaviors the
student is accused of and offer the option of resolution through a conduct hearing or a Carolina Judicial Council hearing.

Hearings are conducted by officials who receive annual training on issues related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and
stalking.These individuals and those assisting throughout the process receive annual training on conducting investigations and hearing
procedures that protect the safety of victims and promote accountability.

To determine if a violation of the Conduct of Conduct has occurred, OSC follows a standard referred to as a preponderance of evidence.
This standard is used by courts of law in civil cases. It must be demonstrated that the charged student is more likely than not to have
violated the Code of Conduct.




Rights of the Accuser
During the student conduct process, the victim has the following rights:

   •   The right to be notified in writing of their rights in the conduct process;
   •   The right to be assisted by various campus entities including but not limited to SAVIP, OSCAI, DLES;
   •   The right to have an advisor of their choosing accompany them throughout the duration of the conduct process;
   •   The right to submit a victim impact statement to the Hearing Officer or Council for consideration;
   •   The right to have their past behaviors excluded in a University Conduct Hearing where responsibility is being de-
   termined;
   •   The right to accommodations in giving testimony consistent with providing a safe atmosphere, and consistent

Rights of Accused
A student accused of violating the Student Code of Conduct is afforded the following rights:

   •   The right to be notified in writing of their rights in the conduct process;
   •   The right to be notified in writing of the charges against them with sufficient time to prepare for a hearing. In the
   event that additional charges are brought, a further written notice must be forwarded to the student(s) or student

   •   The right to present questions for the witnesses to answer. The Hearing Officer/Council may rule on relevance of
   these questions; and
   •   The right to be accompanied by an advisor throughout the hearing process.



The accused’s advisor, with written permission of the charged student(s) or student organization(s), may:

   •   Advise the accused regarding preparation for the hearing;
   •   Accompany the accused to all conduct proceedings; and/or
   •   Have access to information to be introduced at the hearing.

Advisors are not permitted to participate directly in the hearing process, or to speak for the charged student(s) or student organization(s).




Possible Sanctions
The OSC disciplines students who violate the Code of Conduct based on the details in each individual case. Sanctions range from a written
warning to suspension or possible expulsion from the University.

Possible sanctions for violations involving sexual assault, domestic violence, relationship violence, hazing, harassment, stalking or other
violent crimes are:

   •   Issuing a No Contact letter;
   •   Campus restrictions (e.g., from the victim’s residence hall);
   •   Conduct probation;
   •   Assessment with a counseling agency;
   •   Removal from University Housing;
   •   Suspension; and/or
   •   Expulsion.

These sanctions are separate from any criminal charges or sentences imposed against the student in criminal court.



                                                                                                                           University of South Carolina
 page 19     Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                           Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
No Contact Letters and Restraining Orders
A No Contact Letter is an official University notice from the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (OSC) restricting two
University students from initiating contact with each other. Requests for No Contact Letters usually come from students, and require that
both students adhere to the notice.

A benefit of the No Contact Letter is that if it is violated, OSC may levy sanctions against the offender, removing the burden from the
accuser. Violations of a No Contact Letter are violations of the Student Code of Conduct and will be punished by the OSC.

Although a No Contact Letter may be ordered during the hearing process, it is not necessary to have a hearing before one is issued A
student who expresses fear for their safety and the potential for danger if the alleged perpetrator is within geographic proximity should
always apply for a Restraining Order.

Any USC student can request a No Contact Letter; however, both involved parties must be USC students. The student initiating the
request will meet briefly with a staff member in the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. During this meeting, the staff
member will review the parameters of the No Contact Letter and provide the student with the letter, explaining its stipulations. Students
are not obligated to tell the staff member why they are requesting a No Contact Letter, as the student may not have decided to report a
violation/crime.

Students interested in requesting a No Contact Letter may contact the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity at 803-777-
4333. SAVIP and DLES are also available to help facilitate this process.

Beyond a No Contact Letter, a student may obtain a Restraining Order from a court of law to get protection from someone who is harass-
ing or stalking them. A Restraining Order is a civil order and does not appear on a person’s criminal record. However, if the accused violates
the Restraining Order, they can be arrested. A Restraining Order can be granted for up to one year.

The University cannot issue a Restraining Order, only a No Contact Letter. To obtain a Restraining Order, an individual must complete
a Complaint and Motion for Restraining Order and submit it to the Magistrate’s Office in the county where the victim lives or where the
harassment/stalking has taken place. The SAVIP Office and DLES are available to help assist with the application process and provide
support for students who pursue this option.

Notification of Outcomes
The alleged student accused and the alleged victim are notified simultaneously at the OSC hearing and in writing of the outcome of the
proceeding.

Appeals
Both an accused student and alleged victim may appeal the outcome of the OSC hearing. If one student submits an appeal, the other
student in the OSC case will be notified. The other student will have five University business days to submit an appeal if he/she chooses.
After the five days, the appeal(s) will be sent to the Vice President of Student Affairs and Academic Support for consideration at which time
all appeal opportunities are closed.

Hearing outcomes from the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity or designee (including the Carolina Judicial Council) that
meet the criteria for appeal must be submitted via an appeal form within five University business days from the date the decision letter is
received. The OSC will forward it with a response memorandum to the Vice President of Student Affairs.

An appeal may be made for one or both of the following reasons:

   •   A procedural error was committed that has significantly prejudiced the findings of the Hearing Council;



                                                                                                                       University of South Carolina

       OR
   •   New evidence that could not have been available at the time of the hearing and would have a significant effect on
   the outcome of the case becomes available.

Decisions not appealed within five University business days are final. Both the charged student and accuser will be notified simultaneously
and in writing of the outcome of the appeal or any changes to the decision or withdrawal of an appeal by either party.




Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention Office (SAVIP)
Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention (SAVIP) is housed in Student Health Services and is located on the second floor
of the Thomson Building. SAVIP provides 24/7 confidential interpersonal violence advocacy for anyone on the UofSC-Columbia campus
who is impacted by sexual harassment and assault, relationship violence (all forms of relationships), stalking and harassment. SAVIP also
provides primary prevention education on topics that include but are not limited to healthy relationships, consent, bystander intervention,
and survivor support.

Advocacy services offered include:

   •   24/7 access to confidential interpersonal violence advocates;
   •   Academic assistance;
   •   Hospital and meeting & hearing accompaniment;
   •   Temporary alternative housing;
   •   Safety planning;
   •   Consultation; and
   •   Referrals assistance to other campus and community resources.

Students, staff and faculty who are impacted by any type of interpersonal violence can request any of the services listed above to prevent
unnecessary or unwanted contact with their assailant, when reasonably available.

A major role of SAVIP is to provide 24/7 on-call services to assist students, faculty and staff in addition to prevention education to all
students, faculty and staff on campus regarding sexual assault and all forms of interpersonal violence.The staff regularly provide workshops
and training sessions for University faculty and staff, residential student staff, academic classes, and student organizations . SAVIP staff
and trained peer educators provide workshops to students, particularly through University 101 classes offered to first-year students .Topics
includebystanderaccountability,healthyrelationships,consent,survivorsupport,stalking,relationship/datingviolence,andsexualassault.

SAVIP provides survivors options for counseling, medical treatment (if needed), and reporting. Sexual assault survivors may have the
option to complete a sexual assault forensic exam at a local emergency room (recommended hospital is Prisma Health Richland, located at
5 Medical Park Dr., Columbia, SC 29203); survivors who may be interested in this option are encouraged to call SAVIP at 803-777-8248
(this is a crisis line and is in operation 24/7, with the exception of Winter Break) and a confidential advocate can review the survivor’s
options. If a survivor chooses a forensic exam, a SAVIP advocate can provide accompaniment to the emergency room. SAVIP advocates also
review reporting options that include law enforcement and the Office of Civil Rights andTitle IX. For law enforcement reporting, survivors
must report in the jurisdiction in which the crime occurred. They may report to the OCRTIX office if a UofSC student, staff, or faculty
member is the alleged respondent. SAVIP staff provides support and assistance for students that pursue disciplinary procedures and file
criminal charges”.

If you have any questions about services mentioned or would like to receive additional information, call Sexual Assault and Violence
Intervention & Prevention at 803-777-8248 (available 24/7) or go to the Thomson Building during business hours (8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m.

Guidelines for Assistance for Sexual Assault Victims
If you or someone you know is sexually assaulted:

   •   Get to a safe place as soon as you can, and call 911 to contact emergency services if needed or to call an
   ambulance if you believe you may be seriously injured; you may call SAVIP (24/7) at (803)777-8248 to receive sup-
   port and discuss options for immediate care and for reporting, if that is what the survivor wishes. A SAVIP advocate
   can provide accompaniment to the hospital if that is what the survivor wants.
   •   Try to preserve physical evidence. Do not wash, use the toilet, or change clothing if you can avoid it. If you do
   change clothes, put all clothes you were wearing at the time of the assault in a paper, not plastic bag.
   •   Get medical attention as soon as possible to make sure you are physically well and to permit collection of import-
   ant evidence in the event you may later wish to take legal action.
   •   Contact a law enforcement agency to report the assault.
   •   Talk with an advocate or counselor who will maintain confidentiality, help explain your options, give you informa-
   tion, and provide emotional support.
   •   Contact someone you trust for initial and ongoing support.

If an individual does not want to file a criminal complaint with DLES, they may still seek restorative justice by filing a complaint directly
with the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX and inquiring with SAVIP about their options. Help and support are always available through
SAVIP, Counseling and Psychiatry services, and other community resources.

Sexual Assault, Relationship, and Dating Violence Programs
The University of South Carolina prohibits dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.To raise awareness of those issues
and to assist survivors of such violence, the University offers a number of resources to the campus community.

The University utilizes a website to inform the campus community of issues involving interpersonal violence, including sexual assault.The
websitewww.sc.edu/interpersonalviolenceisaone-stopdestinationforinterpersonalviolenceresources,toincludeinterpersonalviolencet
prevention and education programs and resources for survivors.

One of the primary University support units dealing with all forms of interpersonal violence is Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention
& Prevention (SAVIP). SAVIP is located in the Thomson Building. Its advocates offer support and services to students, faculty, and staff
whoaresurvivors ofinterpersonal violence which includes sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, relationship/dating violence,domestic
violence, stalking, and/or harassment.

SAVIP provides educational programming and training throughout the year (see below for a list of programs and trainings). SAVIP also
coordinates annual campus-wide campaigns to raise awareness and promote prevention of interpersonal violence. Notable campaigns
include Relationship Violence Awareness in October, Stalking Awareness in January, and Sexual Assault Awareness in April.

SAVIP recognizes Relationship Violence Awareness Month (RVAM) with events designed to increase awareness about intimate partner
violenceasamajorsocialissue.RVAMeventsincludetablingandeducationalsessionsdesignedtoraiseawarenessofdatingandrelationship
violence, how to recognize warning signs, as well as how to foster healthy relationships, and how to find services for those impacted by
relationship violence.

SAVIP recognizes Stalking Awareness Month with tabling and educational events aimed at fostering understanding about stalking and
harassment. They educate the University Community about stalking methods, including the use of technology, the Rave Guardian app,
options for those who are stalked and how to find services for those impacted by stalking.

SAVIP recognizes Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM) with events aimed at fostering understanding the effects of sexual assault while
promoting a culture of healing and accountability. SAAM events encourage members of the University Community to utilize bystander
intervention methods to prevent sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence.Through education, campaigns, and bystander
accountability, SAVIP actively seeks to foster a Carolina community of respect, trust, equality, and healthy relationships.

Gamecocks Stand Up – Bystander Intervention Program
SAVIP promotes bystander accountability through Gamecocks Stand Up, bystander intervention education that includes four bystander
intervention strategies and resources on and off-campus for those involved in harmful or negative situations.

The scope of Gamecocks Stand Up is diverse, offering informational material, training for students, faculty, and staff, classroom presenta-
tions, and outreach events.

A “bystander” is a person who observes a situation or event but is not directly involved in it. For example, if you’re walking down the
sidewalk and see two cars collide but you don’t get involved you are a bystander to the event. At the other end of the spectrum are“active
           .
bystanders”These   are people who notice a harmful situation is about to happen, is currently happening or has already happened, and then
they make a conscious decision to step in and intervene. In the previous scenario, an active bystander would see the collision but stop to call
USCPD and report the incident.




Changing Carolina Peers Leaders
Changing Carolina Peer Leaders (CCPL) program is a student-run organization that works to educate, advocate for, and engage with peers
by connecting students to on-campus resources. Students work toward inclusive and diverse programs on sexual health, healthy relation-
ships, mental health, and general wellness to promote health equity for all members of the campus community.

Changing Carolina Peer Leaders is a member group of the national peer education student organization BACCHUS Initiatives of NASPA.

Victims and witnesses can receive confidential services through the Counseling and Psychiatry Department (803) 777-5223, Student
Health Services, and SAVIP (803) 777-8248 (24/7). SAVIP staff can explain the reporting process, the rights of victims and witnesses, and
options. Confidentiality will be maintained when speaking to any of these offices, except under very rare circumstances

Other University personnel, however, may have reporting and response obligations University staff, depending on their role, may be
required to share information regarding sexual harassment or misconduct with administrative authorities for investigation and follow up .
The University wishes to support students who have experienced assault, harassment, or abuse in pursuing justice to the extent possible .

The University will protect the confidentiality of an alleged victim by not disclosing the alleged victim’s information to anyone outside the
University to the maximum extent permitted by law The University must balance a victim’s request for confidentiality with its responsi-
bility to provide a safe and non-discriminatory environment for the University community When the University cannot take disciplinary
action against someone accused of discrimination or harassment because of a victim’s wish for confidentiality, the University will pursue
other steps to limit the effects of the alleged sexual misconduct and attempt to prevent its recurrence.

SAVIP can provide safe and confidential support, explain common reactions to crises, and discuss coping methods that may assist
immediately following the assault and later. SAVIP advocates will not reveal the victim’s identity to anyone without the victim’s permission
except under very limited exceptions (e.g. if an immediate threat to the victim or others is present, if the alleged is a repeat offender, or if the
victim is a minor).

Mandatory reporters are afforded the opportunity to submit a report through the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX Office of Equal
Opportunity Program’s website. However, the reporter should know that, during the course of an investigation, his/her identity may be
discovered. If that occurs, the reporter will receive the same confidentiality safeguards offered to those who make a formal report. Reports
submitted through any of the entities listed above are included in the University’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report.

Anonymous tips regarding criminal activity can be made to the Midlands Crimestoppers by dialing 1-888-CRIME-SC or by visiting
http://www.midlandscrimestoppers.com. Individuals may also use the RAVE Guardian app to send anonymous tips or to provide law
enforcement with concerns regarding suspicious activity. DLES does not generally investigate anonymous allegations of criminal activity
outside of CRIMESTOPPERS and the RAVE Guardian app. Anonymous tips without further corroboration are not included in the
University’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report.

The University does not have procedures to encourage pastoral or professional counselors to inform persons they are counseling of how to
report Clery crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for inclusion in the University’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report. The Universi-
ty does not prohibit pastoral or professional counselors from doing so when those individuals deem such advice appropriate.

The University’s Annual Security and Fire Safety Report does not include personal identifying information of victims or reporters. Further,
South Carolina law prohibits the publication of the name of a sexual assault victim.

Crime Prevention
Role of DLES in Crime Prevention
The Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES) conducts crime prevention and safety presentations throughout the year to faculty,
staff and students. Additionally, DLES distributes educational and crime prevention materials at display tables during campus events
throughout the year. This also provides opportunities for students to ask questions, register property, and obtain important safety informa-
tion.

The following programs are designed to inform students and employees about the prevention of crimes:

   •   Residential Safety and Security: methods of securing resident living space both on-campus and off-campus and
   the process of reporting suspicious activity and people.
   •   Building Safety and Security: methods and procedures for keeping the workplace and classroom safe and the
   process of reporting suspicious activity and persons.
   •   Garage/Parking Lot Safety: precautions for preventing theft and vandalism of parked vehicles and risk reduction
   to increase personal safety in and around garages and parking lots.
   •   Campus Safety: general and specific methods of personal protection and risk reduction. Identifies areas that are
   safe for the community, identifies tools available to enhance personal safety, and the outlines the process of reporting
   suspicious activity and individuals.
   •   Workplace Violence Prevention: identifies the warning signs of potential workplace violence and preventive mea-
   sures.
   •   Project ID: offers free engraving for personal and University property. DLES also maintains a database of en-
   graved items.
   •   Project S.T.O.P.: offers bicycle registration.
   •   Women’s Self Defense Workshops: increases recognition and response to potentially dangerous situations, in-
   creasing confidence in everyday activities and encouraging risk reduction practices. The University’s Sexual Assault
   and Violence Intervention & Prevention (SAVIP) Office has partnered with DLES to offer a Women’s Self Defense
   Workshop. Call 777-8248 to sign up.



To get more information about these programs or to schedule a program, contact the DLES Community Relations Unit at 803-777-
4215.

The DLES Office of Crime Prevention also assists in providing safety education to all incoming freshmen and new students through
University 101 (U101).

DLES assigns police officers to specific campus areas and buildings through the Community Resource Officer Program. Community
Resource Officers (CROs) interact with students and residence life staff, offering direct support from a familiar face, providing educational
programs, serving as mentors. The CROs use community policing and problem solving to address quality-of-life issues and build positive
relationships that help students understand how the resources we offer can help keep them and their property safe.

Residential communities are a priority under the CRO program with CROs assigned to academic and administrative buildings as staffing
allows.These officers build partnerships and improve safety by attending community meetings (residence hall meetings, employee safety
committees, etc.) and by making positive community contacts and disseminating crime trend and safety information. CROs pay special
attention to their assigned communities and actively solicit input and information from community members on perceptions of crime and
safety issues.

Role of Housing Staff in Crime Prevention
It should be noted that violent crime on campus is not common.The most prevalent crime our community experiences is theft. University
Housing advises resident students that they should lock residence hall rooms and that anyone parked on campus should remove valuables
from their vehicles. It is also noteworthy to remember that several facilities around campus are open to the public, like theThomas Cooper
Library; it is not uncommon to see non-students in these areas. Care should be taken in these areas to keep personal property under close
watch.

The following security awareness and training programs are offered by University Housing to train/educate Housing staff and students
residing on campus about campus security procedures and practices and to encourage both employees and students to be responsible for
their own security and the security of others.




Training for Housing Staff
All staff members are required to complete an online training course on Crisis Management and Emergency Procedures. At the end of each
session, employees are required to pass a test on the materials presented.

All Housing Staff members participate in another seminar during formal job training on crisis management and University-specific proce-
dures.

AllHousingStaffmembersparticipateinexperientialsessionswheretheyproblem-solvethroughdifferentsituationsandmustdiscernwhen
to apply the procedures they have learned. Training scenarios include: roommate issues; fire safety; alcohol overdose; suicidal students;
drugs; sexual assault; and medical emergencies.

All Housing Staff members are trained on the emergency and safety protocol and procedures specific to the building where they work. Also
included are the security systems in each area, including cameras and card access devices.

All full-time staff and graduate staff members who live and work in a residence hall are required to complete and pass Incident Command
System (ICS) training offered through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

All staff members who serve in an emergency response capacity are trained in the Housing duty system.

Housing Staff members are trained on how to identify and report security issues they discover when working within their assigned build-
ings.

Housing Staff members are trained on the Visitation Policy for their specific buildings.




Crime Prevention Education for Residential Students
All residential buildings on campus have an orientation that covers many topics, including campus safety. When students move into
residential halls on campus, each hosts an orientation that addresses campus safety. Residential Hall floors continue to meet during the
academic year to reinforce safety information and discuss new topics and concerns as needed.

Several methods are used to distribute and reinforce information to students to educate them on safety matters. They include: one-on-one
meetings with students; video boards located in residence halls; email blasts sent to students; print newsletters; flyers; programs and activi-
ties; brochures; and room inspections. Housing Staff conduct room inspections in residence halls, during which they check for prohibited
items and look for any health and safety concerns. Traditional dorms are inspected twice a semester by Housing Staff, while apartment-style
residence halls are inspected monthly. Fire extinguishers are checked monthly in apartment style residences.

All students are informed about the Visitation Policy for their specific residence, and held accountable for violations of the policy.

Students who violate Housing policy or who create safety hazards are met with individually to be held accountable for their actions and to
reinforce their roles as responsible members of our Housing and University Community.




Other Crime Prevention Programs
The Office of Professional Development offers a yearly Violence in the Workplace Workshop for faculty and staff and is in the process of
developing new presentations to bring the University in compliance with recent amendments to the Violence Against Women Act.

Monitoring and Recording
Criminal Activity Including Off-
Campus Organizations
Some official student organizations, including faith based organizations, own private, non-residential facilities off campus. If a local law
enforcement agency is called to respond to one of those facilities, they may notify the DLES of the situation, although this would be done
as a courtesy and not obligation. DLES works with neighboring jurisdictions in identifying criminal activity by students at noncampus
locations. Reporting procedures are established between neighboring jurisdictions and DLES to allow for the documentation of criminal
activity by University students in those jurisdictions with information provided to the University’s Office of Student Conduct and Academic
Integrity.

Access to Campus Facilities
Residence Halls

Most residence hall entrances are staffed with Housing personnel. These employees are charged with the responsibility of
checking the identification of those entering the residences and have direct contact with the Division of Law Enforcement and
Safety (DLES) by telephone. Some residence halls, such as DeSaussure, Thornwell, and Woodrow, are apartment-style and have
no security guard or Housing staff at their entry. All residence halls are within a designated patrol sector and patrolled by DLES
officers day and night. The Greek Village is also patrolled by campus police officers day and night, and some of the houses located
there are equipped with access control systems. They are locked at night, and can only be accessed by authorized students and
staff.

Classrooms

Classroom buildings and individual rooms are under the protection of the DLES.These buildings are within designated patrol sectors and
are patrolled twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Academic buildings with access control systems can only be entered by authorized
persons after hours.

Libraries and other Public Buildings

To maintain a secure campus environment, DLES gives extra attention to University areas open to the public in the routine patrol plan.
Staff located in these areas assist with monitoring the campus environment as well; Thomas Cooper Library uses Closed Circuit TV
(CCTV) cameras, and staff check packages and bags as visitors exit the building. All public buildings on campus are staffed with University
personnel who are instructed on the best method of contacting DLES. DLES patrols all public areas and buildings on campus, providing a
twenty-four hour law enforcement presence.

Athletic Stadiums, Coliseums, and Arenas

CCTV and/or alarm devices monitor most of the areas in which athletic contests are held. Before, during, and after events, DLES officers
and/or contract security personnel patrol and maintain a presence in the area to promote a safe environment and report any security issues.
Suspicious activity observed by contract security personnel is reported to DLES by two-way radio or telephone. Security measures are
customized for the activity to be held.

Garages/Parking Lots

Some garages and parking lots have CCTV cameras, and most have Emergency Call Boxes placed in conspicuous locations. People using
the garages and parking lots are encouraged to report any suspicious activity to DLES. Officers regularly patrol the University’s garages and
lots.

General Campus

In addition to the routine patrol plan of the Division of Law Enforcement and Safety, certain days of the week and weekends are chosen
in which high visibility patrols are implemented.These patrols are designed to exhibit a concentrated law enforcement presence in areas of
the campus frequented by students at night. Special campus events are also common sites of high visibility patrols. DLES officers and/or
contract security, at the request of organizations sponsoring events, provide security at many campus activities.




Security Considerations in the Maintenance of Campus Facilities
Facilities and landscaping are maintained in a manner that minimizes hazardous or unsafe conditions. DLES regularly patrols the campus
and reports unsafe physical conditions to Facility Services or Housing for correction. Housing residents or other members of the University
Community also report equipment problems or potentially hazardous conditions to DLES, Housing, or Facility Services.




                                                                                                                    University of South Carolina

Missing Resident Students
Reporting a Missing Student
When anyone has reason to believe that a student who resides in campus housing is missing, they should immediately notify DLES at
803-777-4215 or call 911. DLES will generate a missing person report and initiate an investigation.

University policy states that when a resident student is missing, reports should be made immediately to any Residence Life staff member or
directly to DLES. In the event that Residence Life staff is made aware that an on-campus residential student is missing, they will immedi-
ately contact DLES and file a missing person report.

Housing staff is required to provide law enforcement with the following information:

   •   The name, building, and room number of the student who is considered missing;
   •   The name(s) of those who initially reported the student missing (friends, roommates, family, etc);
   •   Contact information of person(s) provided by student in the event the student is determined to be missing (which
   is optionally given and kept confidential) as listed in the assignment database; and
   •   Emergency contact information of the missing student (which is kept confidential)



Courtesy and Student Welfare Inspections
Parents or legal guardians of a resident student who are unable to contact their child and, who believe that the student may be in danger
or have suffered a medical debilitating condition may contact DLES. DLES will dispatch an officer to the student’s on-campus address to
determine whether he/she needs emergency assistance.The parent or legal guardian will be informed of the student’s status subject to any
limitations under federal or state law.




                                                                                                                         University of South Carolina
 page 34    Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                          Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
Timely Warning Notices
(Crime Alerts, Campus Safety
Advisories, and their Distribution)
Policies for Making Timely Warning Reports to Members of the Campus
Community
The University of South Carolina makes timely warnings to the University Community regarding certain crimes considered to be a serious
or continuing threat to students, faculty, staff, and visitors when reported to the Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES), and such
warnings will not compromise an on-going criminal investigation.

Generally, DLES will issue a timely warning for the following crimes, when there is reason to believe that perpetrators of crime may present
a threat to the University Community and such disclosures would not harm investigation of incident or apprehension of the subject:

   •   Murder and non-negligent manslaughter;
   •   Manslaughter by negligence;
   •   Sex offenses;
   •   Robbery;
   •   Aggravated assault;
   •   Burglary;
   •   Motor vehicle theft; and
   •   Arson.


A number of factors are considered to determine if there is an ongoing threat to the University Community that would make it necessary
to issue a timely warning. Although the University is not required to provide notification for non-Clery Act crimes or when the incident
does not occur within Clery Act geography, DLES may decide that a warning must be issued if a crime has the potential to compromise the
safety of the University.




Circumstances for Which a Warning Will Be Issued
The following factors and circumstances will be considered when issuing a timely warning:

   •   The nature of the crime;
   •   The continuing danger to the campus community; and
   •   The possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts.



When determining the content of the warning, the University will include as many available details as possible, including:

   •   Type of alert;
   •   Location;
   •   Suspect(s) description;
   •   Incident summary; and
   •   Any information that promotes safety and aids in the prevention of similar crimes.




                                                                                                                     University of South Carolina
 page 36     Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                     Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
Ways Warnings are Disseminated
The University may send timely warnings by various communication media including:

   •   University e-mail;
   •   Carolina Alert social media;
   •   Carolina Alert RSS feed;
   •   Carolina Alert website; and
   •   DLES website.



Additionally, warnings or advisories affecting the University Community will be posted on the DLES web site on the crime alert page:
http://bit.ly/1JGV46m.

The DLES Associate Vice President-Chief of Police or his/her designee will be responsible for authorizing and issuing timely warnings, on
behalf of the University.




                                                                                                                  University of South Carolina
 page 37    Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                   Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
Emergency Response,
Notification, and Evacuation
When it is determined that there is an emergency or dangerous situation that poses an imminent threat to the safety or health of the
Carolina Community, specific University personnel are responsible for activating the Carolina Alert System. The University will immedi-
ately notify the appropriate segment(s) of campus using one or more of the communication mediums in the Carolina Alert System.

Uponreceivingareportornotificationregardingasignificantemergencyordangeroussituationinvolvinganimmediatethreattothesafety
or health of the University of South Carolina Community, the University will confirm the emergency or dangerous situation and determine
the content before initiating an emergency notification. Notification may not be made if it would compromise or impede efforts to assist
victim(s), or contain, respond to, or mitigate the emergency.




Activation Authority
It is the responsibility of the following authorized persons to confirm an emergency, determine the appropriate segment(s) of the campus
community to receive a notification, determine the content of the message, and initiate the selected communication media within the
Carolina Alert emergency notification system:

   •   University’s Division of Law Enforcement and Safety On-Duty Supervisor;
   •   University’s Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES) Emergency Management Coordinator;
   •   DLES Officer with the rank of Lieutenant or above;
   •   DLES Deputy Chief;
   •   DLES Associate Vice President/Chief of Police; and
   •   Chairperson, University’s Executive Policy Group.



When it is appropriate, the authorized individuals (or their designees) will consult the next person in the chain of communication before
sending an emergency message. However, if the next person is unavailable, or if time does not allow for a delayed warning, approval is not
necessary.




Confirmation of an Emergency
If the person(s) authorized to send a message has not confirmed the emergency first-hand, they will contact the DLES on-duty shift
supervisortoreceiveanupdate.Theymayalsochoosetocontactsurroundinglawenforcementagenciesandemergencyresponseagencies
for more information.




Determining Where on Campus to Send Notifications
Those authorized to send a message will also determine which segment(s) of campus will be notified.

The entire campus community may be notified if there is the potential for a very large segment of the community to be affected by the
situation, or when the situation threatens the operation of the entire campus.

If emergency conditions are isolated to a specific part of campus, notifications may be made to that specific area instead of notifying the
entire campus. As the incident progresses, personnel will monitor the situation and notify additional areas of the campus if needed.




                                                                                                                    University of South Carolina
 page 39    Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                     Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
Communication Media
The following is a list of communication media the University may use to send an emergency notification:

   •   Carolina Alert Website: visit www.sc.edu/CarolinaAlert;
   •   Facebook;
   •   Twitter;
   •   University Website www.sc.edu;
   •   Outdoor Warning Sirens;
   •   Tone Alert Radios;
   •   Voice Over Fire Alarms;
   •   Digital Signage;
   •   Alert FM;
   •   Text Alerts;
   •   E-mail;
   •   Emergency Information Line;
   •   90.5 WUSC Radio;
   •   Blackboard Announcement;
   •   Fire Alarm;
   •   Vehicle Public Address Speakers;
   •   Bullhorns; and/or
   •   Media Advisory.



Not all media will be used for every notification. Every incident is unique, and authorized personnel will use communication methods
based on their reach, effectiveness and location.

The following guidelines are used to assist authorized personnel with selecting communication media, and to provide the community an
understanding as to which forms of communication may be used in different scenarios.

Requires Action: If a situation exists that poses an immediate safety risk and requires persons to change their behavior (e.g. seek shelter,
evacuate), information may be pushed using disruptive media (e.g. sirens, Alert FM, text messages, TV message crawler).

Public Notification: If a situation exists where persons should be notified about an incident that is not immediately life threatening
(e.g. crime alerts, situations that have already been contained), media such as the Carolina Alert website, social media, or others may be
used to communicate the information.




Determination of Message Content
The person(s) authorized to send a message will also determine the content of the message. There are a number of pre-scripted, pre-ap-
proved messages from which authorized person(s) may choose from.




                                                                                                                     University of South Carolina

Initiating the Notification System
Once the authorized person has confirmed the emergency, selected the areas of campus that need to be notified, chosen the appropriate
communicationmediatouse,anddeterminedthecontentofthemessage,he/shewillcallthepersonnelresponsibleforphysicallyactivating
each individual communication method.




Follow-Up Communication
Once a mass notification is issued, the person who authorized the notification will immediately contact the University Emergency Manage-
ment Team Executive Policy Group.

The initial notification should be followed by a subsequent message(s) that provides greater detail of the incident and/or protective action
recommendations. If the incident requires an extended response time, subsequent information releases should be done so at the discretion
of the University Public Information Officer or designee.




Disseminating Information to the Surrounding Community
If a dangerous situation exists on campus that has the potential to affect the surrounding Columbia community, the person who authorized
the alert will notify DLES dispatch to call Columbia – Richland 911 Communications Center, or the appropriate authority dependent on
the nature and type of emergency, to make the determination to initiate its community notification process.




Emergency Notification Tests
The Carolina Alert System is tested at least once a year to ensure the system is operational and to introduce members of the Carolina
community to the methods in which they can receive notifications during an emergency.The test also provides information regarding what
to do in the event of an actual emergency.

A summary oftheUniversity’s emergency response and evacuation procedures is distributed in conjunction with at least one annualtest per
year.

After each test or activation of the Carolina Alert system, a brief after action report is written to evaluate the event against measurable
goals.This documentincludes: purpose, date / time, whether the test was announced or unannounced, participants, description,successes,
shortcomings and corrective action recommendations.

Additional information concerning Carolina Alert can be found at: www.sc.edu/CarolinaAlert.

Alcohol And Drug Policies and
Programs To Prevent Alcohol
and Drug Abuse
The University of South Carolina treats the abuse of drugs and alcohol as a serious concern. The University is in compliance with the Drug-
Free Schools and Communities Act of 1989 and has established the Office of Substance Abuse Prevention and Education (SAPE), under
the guidance of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Academic Support.

The University’s drug and alcohol policy is made available to all interested parties. Students, faculty, and staff are encouraged to read the
entire drug and alcohol policies located in the office of the Vice President for Student Affairs and Academic Support and online at “Sub-
stancesAbusePreventionandEducation”,locatedathttps://www.sa.sc.edu/sape.Analcoholanddrugeducationandcounselingprogramis
also provided. Additional information is available by calling (803) 777-3933.

The Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES) works closely with the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (OSC) and
SAPE to educate the student population concerning the responsible use of alcohol. Although every situation is different, officers typically
refer student violators of the state’s alcohol laws to OSC for counseling and student discipline. Violations of the state’s underage drinking
laws may be enforced through filing appropriate criminal charges and are usually handled by OSC with a referral from law enforcement.
Violations of drug laws are usually handled through the local criminal justice system. The vast majority of first time offenders are usually
allowed to enter a diversionary program, referred to as Pre-Trial Intervention, which is coordinated by the local solicitor’s office. Student
violators of drug laws are also referred to OSC.




Policy regarding the possession, use, and sale of alcoholic beverages
No person under the age of 21 may purchase, possess, or consume any alcoholic beverages, and no person shall sell or give alcoholic
beverages to anyone under 21 years of age anywhere at the University of South Carolina – Columbia.

Persons and their guests 21 years of age and older may possess and consume alcoholic beverages in individual campus residence hall rooms
or apartments on campus, but not in the communal areas of a residence hall on campus such as lounges, balconies, decks, or bathrooms.

Common source containers of alcohol (e.g., kegs) are not permitted on the University of South Carolina – Columbia premises any time.

All events sponsored by any entity involving alcoholic beverages in University owned or controlled facilities must be registered through the
Office of the Dean of Students. Upon submission of the Alcohol Event Registration Form, specific information and requirements will be
requested.

Any container of alcohol being transported must be sealed and covered while on University premises.

No person, organization or corporation may sell any kind of alcoholic beverage on the campus of the University, unless there is an alcohol
permit to do so.

No alcohol may be served or consumed in any University building or open space except as provided in the Alcohol Event Registration
Form. This includes personal consumption as well as consumption at a private party event.




Guidelines for Students
Students must adhere to the Student Code of Conduct and the General Guidelines for the University Community as well as all federal,
state, and local laws and ordinances. In addition, students should be aware of the following that under the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (“FERPA”), the University may disclose the result of a disciplinary proceeding to a parent or guardian so long as the student is
under the age of 21 at the time of the incident and the proceeding has resulted in a violation of University drug or alcohol policies or any
federal, state, or local law. The University may also notify a parent or guardian of a student under the age of 21 of any sanction that places
the student on housing or conduct probation (official notice that any additional offense may affect the student’s ability to live on campus or
attend the University), or that results in removal from University Housing or the institution (e.g., housing removal/relocation, suspension,
or expulsion).


                                                                                                                      University of South Carolina
 page 43     Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                      Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
The University may also notify a parent or guardian upon a second violation of the University alcohol policy. Finally, the University’s
Student Care and Outreach Team will notify a parent or guardian of a student under the age of 21 where the consumption of alcohol has
resulted in the hospitalization of the student. For more information or for Consent to Release Information waiver, refer to the Office of
Student Conduct.

Policy regarding the possession, use, and sale of illegal drugs
The University of South Carolina – Columbia supports strict enforcement of laws concerning the possession, consumption, and distribution
of illegal drugs and controlled substances as set forth in the South Carolina Code of Laws, Title 44, Chapter 53. Students, as citizens, are
responsibleforknowing about and complying with South Carolina laws concerning illegal drugs and the use of other controlled substances.

Students are responsible for abiding by the Student Code of Conduct and local, state, and federal laws whether on or off campus. Failure to
do so can result in criminal, civil, and University proceedings and sanctions. Students and student organizations that are in violation of the
law are also violating the Student Code of Conduct and can be held accountable under both separate systems.Violations of the University’s
drug policy as well as other regulations contained in the Carolina Community will be referred to appropriate University offices.

The risks associated with the misuse of alcohol, illegal drugs, prescription medications, and other substances are numerous and include
physicalandmentalimpairment,emotionalandpsychologicaldeterioration,addiction,infectiousdisease,andadverseeffectsonpregnancy.
There are obvious risks, such as suffering a hangover, driving under the influence or committing other crimes, and sustaining or causing
personal injury. There are a number of less obvious risks associated with alcohol and other drug misuse that students and employees may
not realize, including: poor academic and/or job performance, initiating nonconsensual sexual activity, and jeopardizing future career
prospects. In addition, alcohol and other drug misuse puts the user at considerable health risk, which can include nausea, vomiting, cancer,
liver damage, elevated blood pressure, psychotic episodes, hallucinations, and overdose leading to death. A chart on the uses and effects of
controlled substances can be found https://bit.ly/2VkeJJb.

Substance Abuse Prevention and Education
The Substance Abuse Prevention and Education Office (SAPE) is located on the third floor of the Strom Thurmond Wellness and Fitness
Center and is open Monday through Friday during regular business hours. SAPE provides resources about alcohol and other drugs
including DVDs, flyers, brochures, journal and newspaper articles, and local and nationwide data from surveys. SAPE maintains relation-
ships with and listings of alcohol and drug support groups and resources in the Columbia and Midlands area of South Carolina.

Educational Programs
Students Taking Initiative and Responsibility (STIR): The mission of STIR is to help students identify high-risk behavior, reflect on their
decision making skills, and take action towards making safer choices and reducing potential negative consequences. The course design is
a two-session individualized meeting with SAPE graduate students. Participants are typically sanctioned to the STIR program by their
conduct administrators for an alcohol or drug violation, but students may also voluntarily take part to explore their choices about substance
use.

AlcoholEdu: AlcoholEdu is a required educational program and assessment that measures students’ attitudes and perceptions about
substance use and abuse. The course is taken in two parts, both of which are completed online. Part I takes about two and a half hours to
complete, and is done before the student arrives on campus. Part II takes approximately 15 minutes, and is taken 30-45 days after the first
part is completed. All new and transfer undergraduate students must complete AlcoholEdu.

Sexual Assault Prevention for Undergraduates: This program is a required educational and training module about sexual
assault prevention. The course uses realistic scenarios and skill-building exercises. Similar in structure to AlcoholEdu, it is broken into two
parts. Part I takes around an hour and a half to complete. After a 30-45 day waiting period, students must complete Part II, which takes
about 15 minutes.

Criminal statistics
How We Compile These Statistics
A primary part of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is the statistics related to crime that have occurred at the University during the
preceding calendar year. To assist in evaluating the statistics in context, the preceding three calendar years are provided for your review.

DLES, in compiling the annual statistics, coordinates with law enforcement partners as well as University Campus Security Authorities.
DLES, along with the Richland County Sheriff’s Department and the City of Columbia Police Department, share information about
criminal incidents through the Lexis/Nexis Community Crime Map.




Community Crime Map
The Community Crime Map (www.communitycrimemap.com) is a crime mapping program made available to both the general public and
law enforcement.The program allows site visitors to see crime data over a map of the county. Through the Community Crime Map system,
DLES, the Richland County Sheriff’s Department, and City of Columbia Police Department can share crime data, crime intelligence, and
criminal reports. This program also allows DLES, when compiling the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report to directly retrieve informa-
tion about crimes occurring off campus or on public property investigated by another agency.

A public version of the Community Crime Map program is also available. The public system allows a user to search crimes by address or by
clicking on Columbia, South Carolina.The user interface shows a map of a particular area with incidents clearly marked. By clicking on the
incident location pin, the user obtains basic information about the incident such as: type of crime; location type; block-level address; and
incident date and time.




Sex Offender Data

Crime Data
The Clery Act requires the University to report data regarding specific crimes that happen within a defined geographical area to the United
States Department of Education and then disclose the data to the general community. This area is referred to as “Clery Geography” and
encompasses On Campus (including the subset of On Campus Residence Halls), Non-Campus, and Public Property. These terms create
consistency in the way crime data is collected and reported across college campuses.

   For purposes of the Clery Act and understanding disclosed data, the following definitions are used:
   1) On-Campus is defined as either –
   a. Any property –
   Owned or controlled by the University;
   That is reasonably contiguous to other University owned property; and
   That is used by the University in direct support or in relation to the University’s educational purpose.



   OR

                                                                                                                           University of South Carolina
 page 46     Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                           Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
   b. Any property –
   Owned but not controlled by the University;
   That is used frequently by University students; and
   That is used to support the University’s educational purpose.


   2) Non-Campus is defined as either –
   a. Any property –
   Owned or controlled by the University;
   That is used by the University to support its educational purposes;
   That is frequently used by students; and
   Is not considered part of the core campus.
   OR
   b. Any property –
   Owned or controlled by a student organization; and
   That the student organization is officially recognized by the University.


   3) Public Property is defined as any property
   Owned or controlled by governmental entities such as thoroughfares, streets, sidewalks, and parking facilities;
   That is within the campus, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.


   An example of On-Campus property would be many of the University classrooms and buildings located throughout
   its core campus. Non-Campus areas include Williams-Brice Stadium. Public property would be the public sidewalk
   located in front of the Horseshoe.

Annual Fire Safety Report
Fire Log
The Housing facility fire log is kept at the DLES Records Unit located at 1415 Henderson Street, Columbia, South Carolina 29208. The
log includes. This log includes the nature, date, time, and location of each fire.




Education, Training, Drills, Evacuation, Reporting
All Resident Mentors for each housing facility are trained in the use of fire extinguishers (to include use of with a live fire exercise), building
evacuation, proper reporting of fires, the prohibitive use of extension cords and oversized light bulbs, blocking of fire sprinklers, and fire
alarm equipment.The training each Resident Mentor receives is then provided to residents of each residence hall in the first weekly meeting
after move-in.

DLES Fire Safety provides training to faculty, staff, students and food service vendors on campus. The training is tailored to the audience
to provide the most applicable information related to their environment. The training consists of how to safely evacuate a building during
a fire situation or other emergency, by outlining exit awareness and potential obstacles. The training also includes how to minimize the
opportunity for fire and the proper procedures for reporting a fire. The class is finalized with fire extinguisher training that includes a
summary on the types of fire extinguishers and the proper technique for discharging them, with the participants having the opportunity to
discharge a fire extinguisher on a controlled fire.

In accordance with state law and for the safety of students, fire drills are conducted at various times throughout the semester. All persons
must vacate the building during drills and remain outside until instructed to return by residence hall staff. Evacuation procedures are posted
in each residence hall.

DLES holds an annual “Fire Safety Awareness Day” to coincide with “National Fire Safety Week” in October of each year. During the event
a mock residence hall room is constructed and fire hazards are intentionally created within the room. Students are encouraged to identify
the hazard to win prizes. The Columbia Fire Department assists and displays equipment and rescue techniques. The room is set on fire at
the end of the event to demonstrate how quickly a room will burn and how important it is to follow established fire safety policies and
procedures.



All students and employees must evacuate the building or residence hall in the event of a fire and follow
the below procedures:

Some of these actions can be taken simultaneously:

The building shall be evacuated. In those buildings that have coded alarm systems in which the alarm rings only on the floor where the pull
station is activated, the general alarm shall be sounded to alert all occupants to evacuate;

DLES shall be notified by dialing 911;

Supervisory personnel should search the area in which the alarm was activated to determine the location of the fire;

The determination if an alarm is a“nuisance fire alarm”shall be made by Columbia Fire Department. If the fire department is not present,
this determination shall be made by a representative from DLES – Fire Safety Office; and




                                                                                                                          University of South Carolina
 page 51     Annual Security and Fire Safety Report                                                          Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
The fire alarm shall be silenced and reset only by a representative from the Columbia Fire Department or DLES when directed to do so by
one of the aforementioned entities.

The University requires any fire to be immediately reported to the appropriate local authorities to include DLES.




Portable Electrical Appliances and Open Flames
The cooking of food in residence halls is primarily restricted to established kitchens. The only cooking equipment allowed in rooms are
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approved appliances that have no exposed heating coils (such as coffee pots and sandwich makers), and
microwave ovens which do not exceed one cubic foot and/or 700 watts of power. One privately owned refrigerator per resident is permitted
provided it does not exceed limitations established by the University. Extension cords and multiple socket plugs are prohibited due to
electrical circuitry design limitations as well as health, fire, and safety regulations. Surge protectors with a circuit breaker and an on/off
switch are approved for use in rooms or apartments. Only one surge protector may be plugged into a socket and at no time may one surge
protector be plugged into another surge protector.

In conjunction with University Policy, smoking and the use of tobacco products is prohibited on all campus property. All members of the
University residence hall community, including visitors and vendors working on campus, are expected to comply with this policy.

No person shall start a fire or create a fire hazard on University property without University authorization.This regulation is also intended
to prohibit the possession and/or use of candles, torches, incense burners, other open flame apparatus, as well as extension cords and other
devices or materials which may create a fire hazard if used without authorization or in unauthorized areas including, but not limited to,
residence hall rooms.




Misuse of Fire Alarms and Safety Equipment
No person shall make, or cause to be made, a false fire alarm, or emergency report of any kind. No person shall tamper with, damage,
disable or misuse fire safety equipment including, but not limited to, fire extinguishers, fire hoses, fire alarms, and fire doors.




Plans for Future Improvement
There are no current plans to modify the University’s residential fire detection and warning systems at this time.




Fire Alarm System Monitoring and Fire Extinguishers
All fire alarm systems in residence halls are monitored through central reporting. All residence halls have fire extinguishers installed per
national standards and undergo four fire drills per year.

University Residential Facilities
The following residential facilities have fire safety systems with addressable fire alarms and are fully sprinkled. The term“addressable fire
alarm” as used in these statistics includes devices that provide exact location, for example, suite number, bedroom number, flow switch
location, etc. of alarm initiation. The location of the residence facility is also provided below the name of the facility. All University residen-
tial facilities undergo four fire drills per calendar year.
