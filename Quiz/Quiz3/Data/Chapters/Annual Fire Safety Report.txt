Fire Log

The Housing facility fire log is kept at the DLES Records Unit located at 1415 Henderson Street, Columbia, South Carolina 29208. The
log includes. This log includes the nature, date, time, and location of each fire.




Education, Training, Drills, Evacuation, Reporting

All Resident Mentors for each housing facility are trained in the use of fire extinguishers (to include use of with a live fire exercise), building
evacuation, proper reporting of fires, the prohibitive use of extension cords and oversized light bulbs, blocking of fire sprinklers, and fire
alarm equipment.The training each Resident Mentor receives is then provided to residents of each residence hall in the first weekly meeting
after move-in.

DLES Fire Safety provides training to faculty, staff, students and food service vendors on campus. The training is tailored to the audience
to provide the most applicable information related to their environment. The training consists of how to safely evacuate a building during
a fire situation or other emergency, by outlining exit awareness and potential obstacles. The training also includes how to minimize the
opportunity for fire and the proper procedures for reporting a fire. The class is finalized with fire extinguisher training that includes a
summary on the types of fire extinguishers and the proper technique for discharging them, with the participants having the opportunity to
discharge a fire extinguisher on a controlled fire.

In accordance with state law and for the safety of students, fire drills are conducted at various times throughout the semester. All persons
must vacate the building during drills and remain outside until instructed to return by residence hall staff. Evacuation procedures are posted
in each residence hall.

DLES holds an annual “Fire Safety Awareness Day” to coincide with “National Fire Safety Week” in October of each year. During the event
a mock residence hall room is constructed and fire hazards are intentionally created within the room. Students are encouraged to identify
the hazard to win prizes. The Columbia Fire Department assists and displays equipment and rescue techniques. The room is set on fire at
the end of the event to demonstrate how quickly a room will burn and how important it is to follow established fire safety policies and
procedures.



All students and employees must evacuate the building or residence hall in the event of a fire and follow
the below procedures:

Some of these actions can be taken simultaneously:

The building shall be evacuated. In those buildings that have coded alarm systems in which the alarm rings only on the floor where the pull
station is activated, the general alarm shall be sounded to alert all occupants to evacuate;

DLES shall be notified by dialing 911;

Supervisory personnel should search the area in which the alarm was activated to determine the location of the fire;

The determination if an alarm is a“nuisance fire alarm”shall be made by Columbia Fire Department. If the fire department is not present,
this determination shall be made by a representative from DLES – Fire Safety Office; and
The fire alarm shall be silenced and reset only by a representative from the Columbia Fire Department or DLES when directed to do so by
one of the aforementioned entities.

The University requires any fire to be immediately reported to the appropriate local authorities to include DLES.


Portable Electrical Appliances and Open Flames

The cooking of food in residence halls is primarily restricted to established kitchens. The only cooking equipment allowed in rooms are
Underwriters Laboratories (UL) approved appliances that have no exposed heating coils (such as coffee pots and sandwich makers), and
microwave ovens which do not exceed one cubic foot and/or 700 watts of power. One privately owned refrigerator per resident is permitted
provided it does not exceed limitations established by the University. Extension cords and multiple socket plugs are prohibited due to
electrical circuitry design limitations as well as health, fire, and safety regulations. Surge protectors with a circuit breaker and an on/off
switch are approved for use in rooms or apartments. Only one surge protector may be plugged into a socket and at no time may one surge
protector be plugged into another surge protector.

In conjunction with University Policy, smoking and the use of tobacco products is prohibited on all campus property. All members of the
University residence hall community, including visitors and vendors working on campus, are expected to comply with this policy.

No person shall start a fire or create a fire hazard on University property without University authorization.This regulation is also intended
to prohibit the possession and/or use of candles, torches, incense burners, other open flame apparatus, as well as extension cords and other
devices or materials which may create a fire hazard if used without authorization or in unauthorized areas including, but not limited to,
residence hall rooms.




Misuse of Fire Alarms and Safety Equipment

No person shall make, or cause to be made, a false fire alarm, or emergency report of any kind. No person shall tamper with, damage,
disable or misuse fire safety equipment including, but not limited to, fire extinguishers, fire hoses, fire alarms, and fire doors.




Plans for Future Improvement

There are no current plans to modify the University’s residential fire detection and warning systems at this time.




Fire Alarm System Monitoring and Fire Extinguishers

All fire alarm systems in residence halls are monitored through central reporting. All residence halls have fire extinguishers installed per
national standards and undergo four fire drills per year.

University Residential Facilities

The following residential facilities have fire safety systems with addressable fire alarms and are fully sprinkled. The term“addressable fire
alarm” as used in these statistics includes devices that provide exact location, for example, suite number, bedroom number, flow switch
location, etc. of alarm initiation. The location of the residence facility is also provided below the name of the facility. All University residen-
tial facilities undergo four fire drills per calendar year.
