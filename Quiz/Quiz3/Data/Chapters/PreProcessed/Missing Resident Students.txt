 Missing Resident Students
 Reporting a Missing Student
 When anyone has reason to believe that a student who resides in campus housing is missing, they should immediately notify DLES at 803-777-4215 or call 911. DLES will generate a missing person report and initiate an investigation.
 University policy states that when a resident student is missing, reports should be made immediately to any Residence Life staff member or directly to DLES. In the event that Residence Life staff is made aware that an on-campus residential student is missing, they will immedi- ately contact DLES and file a missing person report.
 Housing staff is required to provide law enforcement with the following information:
 •   The name, building, and room number of the student who is considered missing;
 •   The name(s) of those who initially reported the student missing (friends, roommates, family, etc);
 •   Contact information of person(s) provided by student in the event the student is determined to be missing (which is optionally given and kept confidential) as listed in the assignment database; and
 •   Emergency contact information of the missing student (which is kept confidential)

 Parents or legal guardians of a resident student who are unable to contact their child and, who believe that the student may be in danger or have suffered a medical debilitating condition may contact DLES. DLES will dispatch an officer to the student’s on-campus address to determine whether he/she needs emergency assistance.The parent or legal guardian will be informed of the student’s status subject to any limitations under federal or state law.
