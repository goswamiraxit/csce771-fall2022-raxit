 Timely Warning Notices (Crime Alerts, Campus Safety Advisories, and their Distribution)
 Policies for Making Timely Warning Reports to Members of the Campus Community
 The University of South Carolina makes timely warnings to the University Community regarding certain crimes considered to be a serious or continuing threat to students, faculty, staff, and visitors when reported to the Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES), and such warnings will not compromise an on-going criminal investigation.
 Generally, DLES will issue a timely warning for the following crimes, when there is reason to believe that perpetrators of crime may present a threat to the University Community and such disclosures would not harm investigation of incident or apprehension of the subject:
 •   Murder and non-negligent manslaughter;
 •   Manslaughter by negligence;
 •   Sex offenses;
 •   Robbery;
 •   Aggravated assault;
 •   Burglary;
 •   Motor vehicle theft; and
 •   Arson.
 A number of factors are considered to determine if there is an ongoing threat to the University Community that would make it necessary to issue a timely warning. Although the University is not required to provide notification for non-Clery Act crimes or when the incident does not occur within Clery Act geography, DLES may decide that a warning must be issued if a crime has the potential to compromise the safety of the University.
 Circumstances for Which a Warning Will Be Issued
 The following factors and circumstances will be considered when issuing a timely warning:
 •   The nature of the crime;
 •   The continuing danger to the campus community; and
 •   The possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts.
 When determining the content of the warning, the University will include as many available details as possible, including:
 •   Type of alert;
 •   Location;
 •   Suspect(s) description;
 •   Incident summary; and
 •   Any information that promotes safety and aids in the prevention of similar crimes.
 Ways Warnings are Disseminated
 The University may send timely warnings by various communication media including:
 •   University e-mail;
 •   Carolina Alert social media;
 •   Carolina Alert RSS feed;
 •   Carolina Alert website; and
 •   DLES website.
 Additionally, warnings or advisories affecting the University Community will be posted on the DLES web site on the crime alert page: http://bit.ly/1JGV46m.
 The DLES Associate Vice President-Chief of Police or his/her designee will be responsible for authorizing and issuing timely warnings, on behalf of the University.
