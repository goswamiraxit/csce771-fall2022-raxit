 Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Relationship Violence and Stalking
 All forms of assault, abuse, harassment and violence are not tolerated at the University of South Carolina. There are confidential resources at the University and in the community to assist victims of interpersonal violence. The University works to educate, inform, and advocate for the Carolina Community to end sexual assault, stalking, and relationship violence.
 What is Consent?
 The University of South Carolina defines consent as“the clear, knowing, and voluntary, agreement to participate in mutually agreed-upon acts. Consent can be given by words and/or actions, as long as those words and/or actions create mutually understandable clear permission regarding willingness to engage in (and the conditions of ) the sexual activity”. It is the responsibility of each party to determine that the other(s) has consented before engaging in the sexual activity.
 The University of South Carolina defines consent as permitting, approving, or agreeing to act under University policy CR 1.00 (Discrim- ination, Harassment and Sexual Misconduct). University policy CR 1.00 is available at https://www.sc.edu/policies/ppm/cr100.pdf. For consent to take place, the following elements must be present:
 •   Both are clear about their intent to engage in sexual activities and their desire to do so is willing.
 •   Both individuals are fully conscious.
 •   Someone who is incapacitated cannot consent.
 •   Neither individual is impaired by drugs or alcohol to the extent they do not know the who, what, when, where, why, or how of the situation.
 •   Coercion, force, or threat of either cancels consent.
 •   Consent to engage in one form of sexual activity does not provide consent to engage in any other form of sexual activity.
 •   Past consent of sexual activities does not imply future consent.
 •   Consent to engage in sexual activity with one person does not give consent to engage in sexual activity with someone else.
 •   The existence of a prior or current relationship does not, in itself, constitute consent; even in the context of a relationship, there must be real time and mutual consent to sexual activity.
 •   Consent can be withdrawn or modified at any time, and sexual contact must cease immediately once consent is withdrawn and clearly communicated.
 •   Consent cannot be inferred from the absence of a “no”.
 •   Consent cannot be inferred from silence, passivity, or lack of verbal or physical resistance. Consent may not be given by an individual who has not reached the legal age of consent under applicable law.
 Definitions of Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, and Stalking
 To help you better understand the policies outlined in this report, terms used in University Policies on Sexual Assault and Interpersonal Violence are defined below. Additionally, definitions for similar terms and related statutes from the South Carolina Code of Laws are provided for reference. Terminology and state law vary from University Policy at times. This creates circumstances where DLES may not be abletobringcriminalchargesagainstanindividualaccusedofviolatingUniversityPolicy.However,UniversityPolicyoutlinesconsequences for the accused perpetrator if they are a member of the University Community, as well as protections for the accuser. This process occurs in the presence or absence of criminal charges.
 Interpersonal Violence: acts of relationship violence including domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, and harassment.
 Domestic Violence: For purposes of University policy CR 1.00 (Discrimination, Harassment, and Sexual Misconduct) and related procedures, this term refers to physical violence, threats of violence against another, threats of violence against individuals close to, pets of, or property belonging to an individual with a connection to a perpetrator as defined by University policy ro state law.
 Domestic violence is defined by South Carolina state law, S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-20, as the unlawful causing of “physical harm or injury to a person’s own household member”or the“offer or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a person’s own household member with apparent present ability in circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril .”A“household member”includes a spouse, a former spouse, persons who have a child in common, cohabitants involved during a romantic relationship or those who formerly cohabitated during a romantic relationship.
 Dating Violence: any act of violence or threats of violence committed by a person: 1. who is or has been in a social relationship of a romantic or intimate nature with the Complainant; and 2. where the existence of such a relationship will be determined based on a consideration of the following factors: the length of the relationship; the type of relationship; and the frequency of interaction between the persons involved in the relationship. Dating violence is not a specific criminal violation in South Carolina. However, the state does prohibit a number of physically violent actions to include Homicide, Manslaughter, and Assault and Battery in multiple degrees, which may be applicable.
 Stalking: A course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person under similar circumstances or with similar identities to fear for their own safety or the safety of others or suffer substantial emotional distress. Course of conduct means two or more instances, including but not limited to; unwelcome acts in which an individual directly, indirectly, or through third parties, by any action, method, device, or means, follows, monitors, observes, surveils, threatens, or communicates to or about a person, or interferes with a person’s property. Stalking includes the concept of cyber-stalking, a particular form of stalking in which electronic media such as the internet, social networks, blogs, cell phones, texts, or other similar devices or forms of contact are used. South Carolina law, S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-1700, also prohibits stalking which is defined as a “pattern of words, whether verbal written, or electronic, or a pattern” of “two or more acts occurring over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of purpose”that“serves no legitimate purpose and is intended to cause and does cause a targeted person and would cause a reasonable person in the targeted person’s position to fear”either“(1) death of the person or a member of his family; (2) assault upon the person or a member of his family; (3) bodily injury to the person or a member of his family; (4) criminal sexual contact on the person or a member of his family; (5) kidnapping of the person or a member of his family; or (6) damage to the property of the person or a member of his family”.
 Non-Consensual sexual contact (Offensive Touching): the touching of an unwilling or non-consenting person’s intimate parts such as genitalia, groin, breast, buttocks, mouth, and/or clothes covering them; the touching of an unwilling person with one’s own intimate parts; or forcing an unwilling person to touch another’s intimate parts. Offensive Touching falls generally within the Clery Crime Category of “Forcible Fondling”.
 Sexual Assault: any form of sexual contact that occurs without consent and/or through the use of force, threat of force, intimidation, incapacitationorcoercion.SexualAssaultincludesnon-consensualsexualcontact,non-consensualsexualpenetration,incestandstatutory rape. State criminal law defines a sexual assault generally as the unwilling, non-consensual penetration of any bodily opening with any object or body part that is committed by force, threat, intimidation, or through exploitation of another’s mental or physical condition of which the assailant was aware or should have been aware. State law governing such actions is found in S.C. Code Ann. §16-3-600 and §16-3-652 to 655.
 Criminal Investigation
 If survivors or witnesses want to file formal criminal charges against a perpetrator or request a criminal investigation, they can contact DLES via 9-1-1; activate an Emergency Call Box by pushing the large red button on the front; contact law enforcement through the RAVE Guardian app; or call (803) 777-4215 for the 24-hour dispatch line. Additionally, a victim may also request assistance from law enforce- ment if they are at a hospital to receive medical treatment for injuries that happened as the result of a crime.
 Once a crime is reported, DLES will send a uniformed officer and/or criminal investigator to the victim. DLES criminal investigators receive special training in handling sexual assault cases and relationship-based crimes. DLES may, in certain circumstances, request assis- tance from the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), the state’s primary criminal investigative agency.
 In most cases, a DLES victim advocate is there to help the survivor in a number of ways, such as explaining the investigative process; putting them in contact with SAVIP staff; and providing any additional help the victim may have in their time of need.
 Rights of Victims
 Under South Carolina law, victims have a number of rights, including:
 •   the right to be treated with fairness, respect, and dignity, and to be free from intimidation, harassment, or abuse, throughout the criminal and juvenile justice process, and informed of the victim’s constitutional rights, provided by statute;
 •   the right to be reasonably informed when the accused or convicted person is arrested, released from custody, or has escaped;
 •   the right to be informed of and present at any criminal proceedings which are dispositive of the charges where the defendant has the right to be present;
 •   the right to be reasonably informed of and be allowed to submit either a written or oral statement at all hearings affecting bond or bail;
 •   the right to be heard at any proceeding involving a post-arrest release decision, a plea, or sentencing;
 •   the right to be reasonably protected from the accused or persons acting on his behalf throughout the criminal justice process;
 •   the right to confer with the prosecution, after the crime against the victim has been charged, before the trial or before any disposition and informed of the disposition;
 •   the right to have reasonable access after the conclusion of the criminal investigation to all documents relating to the crime against the victim before trial;
 •   the right to receive prompt and full restitution from the person or persons convicted of the criminal conduct that caused the victim’s loss or injury including both adult and juvenile offenders;
 •   the right to be informed of any proceeding when any post-conviction action is being considered, and be present at any post-conviction hearing involving a post-conviction release decision;
 •   the right to a reasonable disposition and prompt and final conclusion of the case; and
 •   the right to have all rules governing criminal procedure and the admissibility of evidence in all criminal proceed- ings protect victims’ rights and have these rules subject to amendment or repeal by the legislature to ensure protec- tion of these rights. Beyond these rights, DLES provides additional assistance to crime victims, including:
 •   providing a free copy of incident reports when requested;
 •   providing information about local victim assistance providers;
 •   informing them of how to be compensated by the State Office of Victim Assistance (SOVA) and assistance in applying for compensation and other forms of assistance that may be available.
 DLES victim advocates are trained in assisting victims and can serve as liaisons for them following a crime. They provide other forms of support and advocacy that make the criminal justice process less intimidating for victims.
 University Administrative Inquiries
 Incertaincircumstances,studentsthatengageinconductthatviolatestheUniversity’sstandardsmaybesubjecttotheUniversity’sadminis- trative process.This process typically involves an investigation, conduct hearing, and potential disciplinary action by the University’s Office of Civil Rights and Title IX (OCR) and/or Office of Student Conduct (OSC).
 A student may file a complaint directly with DLES, (OCR), or OSC. However, in some cases, the process starts when a student seeks help from University Health Services’ Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention Office (SAVIP). Beyond providing a wide range of assistance for victims, SAVIP can assist a victim in the process of filing complaints with DLES, OCR, and/or OSC. More information regarding the assistance SAVIP may offer is provided in this report.
 Office of Civil Rights and Title IX
 Through the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX (OCR-TIX), students, faculty, and staff may report incidents where members of the University Community have experienced discrimination and/or harassment based on age, race, ethnicity, sex, gender, religion, national origin, disability, genetics, or veteran status.
 OCR-TIX also handles Title IX complaints. Recently, the United States Department of Education has emphasized that Title IX requires Universities to include sexual assaults, sexual harassment, sexual violence, and sexual misconduct involving members of the University Community under their investigative authority. Title IX also prohibits retaliation against an individual who, in good faith, asserts his/her rights under Title IX or other federal and state laws prohibiting discrimination.
 Any student with a complaint of discrimination or discriminatory harassment should contact OCR-TIX. Students can file complaints against faculty, staff, other students, student organizations, and any entity doing business or associated with the University. If you believe you have experienced discrimination or harassment based on your status as a protected group, contact OCR-TIX at (803) 777-3854 for assistance, or submit your information to OCR-TIX using the“Report an Incident”option at https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divi- sions/civil_rights_title_ix/.
 Certain employees and persons associated with the University must contact the OCR-TIX if they receive a report from a student that has experienced harassment including but not limited to sexual misconduct, sexual violence, sexual assault, or any criminal behavior based on sex or discrimination.These persons with a duty to report include administrators, supervisors, department chairs, or person in a position of power over a student. Failure to immediately report any Title IX matter may result in disciplinary action against any person (e.g., administrators, faculty or staff members) in a position of power over a student. Students or staff may file a complaint at https://cm.maxient. com/reporting.php?UnivofSouthCarolina.
 Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity
 The Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (OSC) is a University department designed to promote individual student developmentandacampusclimateofcivilityandaccountability.Thisofficeencourageseducationandaccountabilitybyprovidingprocesses designed to uphold the behavioral expectations of the University’s Code of Conduct.
 OSC reviews a wide range of student violations of the Code of Conduct from alcohol violations to sexual assaults. The investigation and possible prosecution of a University student in the criminal justice system does not prevent them from also being subject to civil sanctions imposed by the University. The University holds students to the standards outlined in the Code of Conduct while they are on campus or any other location for as long as they remain students at the University.
 OSC may begin a student conduct investigation upon receiving information that a University student has violated the Code of Conduct. Typically OSC receives such information from DLES, SAVIP, OCR-TIX, or through a complaint filed by another student. University students are also required to notify OSC within 72 hours after they have been arrested by a law enforcement agency other than DLES.
 A complaint form may be submitted to OSC online at https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_conduct_and_academic_in- tegrity/make_a_report/. Once a complaint is received, OSC will meet with individuals thought to have relevant information, including the student who has been accused. OSC will assess the Code of Conduct to determine which charges most closely meet the behaviors the student is accused of and offer the option of resolution through a conduct hearing or a Carolina Judicial Council hearing.
 Hearings are conducted by officials who receive annual training on issues related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.These individuals and those assisting throughout the process receive annual training on conducting investigations and hearing procedures that protect the safety of victims and promote accountability.
 To determine if a violation of the Conduct of Conduct has occurred, OSC follows a standard referred to as a preponderance of evidence. This standard is used by courts of law in civil cases. It must be demonstrated that the charged student is more likely than not to have violated the Code of Conduct.
 Rights of the Accuser
 During the student conduct process, the victim has the following rights:
 •   The right to be notified in writing of their rights in the conduct process;
 •   The right to be assisted by various campus entities including but not limited to SAVIP, OSCAI, DLES;
 •   The right to have an advisor of their choosing accompany them throughout the duration of the conduct process;
 •   The right to submit a victim impact statement to the Hearing Officer or Council for consideration;
 •   The right to have their past behaviors excluded in a University Conduct Hearing where responsibility is being de- termined;
 •   The right to accommodations in giving testimony consistent with providing a safe atmosphere, and consistent with the rights of the accused;
 •   The right to be notified in writing of the final determination and any sanction imposed on the accused as a result of the conduct process;
 •   The right to receive a copy of the formal charges sent to the accused student;
 •   The right to be notified of the date, time, and place of hearings at least three University business days prior to the hearing;
 •   The right to have the hearing authority consider as an aggravating factor when sanctioning the perpetrator whether the perpetrator provided alcohol or other drugs in the commission of a sexual assault;
 •   The right to be notified of the findings and sanctions/outcome of the hearing within a timeframe close to that in which the charged student was notified;
 •   The right to appeal the outcome based on a due process error or on information that could not have been avail- able at the time of the hearing; and
 •   The right to changes in academic, living, transportation, or working situations to avoid a hostile environment.
 Rights of Accused
 A student accused of violating the Student Code of Conduct is afforded the following rights:
 •   The right to be notified in writing of their rights in the conduct process;
 •   The right to be notified in writing of the charges against them with sufficient time to prepare for a hearing. In the event that additional charges are brought, a further written notice must be forwarded to the student(s) or student organization(s). The student(s) or student organization(s) may waive the right to separate written notice of additional charges in order to expedite the hearing process;
 •   The right to be notified of the date, time, and place of formal hearings at least three University business days prior to the hearing;
 •   The right to know the nature and source of the information used in a hearing process. This includes the right to review all documents and exhibits to be introduced at a hearing as well as a list of witnesses asked to testify at the hearing, upon the student’s request;
 •   The right to present information on one’s behalf;
 •   The right to elect not to appear at the hearing, in which case the hearing shall be conducted in the absence of the charged party(ies);
 •   The right to refuse to answer any questions or make a statement. However, the hearing authority may draw infer- ences from this refusal;
 •   The right to present questions for the witnesses to answer. The Hearing Officer/Council may rule on relevance of these questions; and
 •   The right to be accompanied by an advisor throughout the hearing process.
 The accused’s advisor, with written permission of the charged student(s) or student organization(s), may:
 •   Advise the accused regarding preparation for the hearing;
 •   Accompany the accused to all conduct proceedings; and/or
 •   Have access to information to be introduced at the hearing.
 Advisors are not permitted to participate directly in the hearing process, or to speak for the charged student(s) or student organization(s).
 Possible Sanctions
 The OSC disciplines students who violate the Code of Conduct based on the details in each individual case. Sanctions range from a written warning to suspension or possible expulsion from the University.
 Possible sanctions for violations involving sexual assault, domestic violence, relationship violence, hazing, harassment, stalking or other violent crimes are:
 •   Issuing a No Contact letter;
 •   Campus restrictions (e.g., from the victim’s residence hall);
 •   Conduct probation;
 •   Assessment with a counseling agency;
 •   Removal from University Housing;
 •   Suspension; and/or
 •   Expulsion.
 These sanctions are separate from any criminal charges or sentences imposed against the student in criminal court.
 No Contact Letters and Restraining Orders
 A No Contact Letter is an official University notice from the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity (OSC) restricting two University students from initiating contact with each other. Requests for No Contact Letters usually come from students, and require that both students adhere to the notice.
 A benefit of the No Contact Letter is that if it is violated, OSC may levy sanctions against the offender, removing the burden from the accuser. Violations of a No Contact Letter are violations of the Student Code of Conduct and will be punished by the OSC.
 Although a No Contact Letter may be ordered during the hearing process, it is not necessary to have a hearing before one is issued A student who expresses fear for their safety and the potential for danger if the alleged perpetrator is within geographic proximity should always apply for a Restraining Order.
 Any USC student can request a No Contact Letter; however, both involved parties must be USC students. The student initiating the request will meet briefly with a staff member in the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. During this meeting, the staff member will review the parameters of the No Contact Letter and provide the student with the letter, explaining its stipulations. Students are not obligated to tell the staff member why they are requesting a No Contact Letter, as the student may not have decided to report a violation/crime.
 Students interested in requesting a No Contact Letter may contact the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity at 803-777- 4333. SAVIP and DLES are also available to help facilitate this process.
 Beyond a No Contact Letter, a student may obtain a Restraining Order from a court of law to get protection from someone who is harass- ing or stalking them. A Restraining Order is a civil order and does not appear on a person’s criminal record. However, if the accused violates the Restraining Order, they can be arrested. A Restraining Order can be granted for up to one year.
 The University cannot issue a Restraining Order, only a No Contact Letter. To obtain a Restraining Order, an individual must complete a Complaint and Motion for Restraining Order and submit it to the Magistrate’s Office in the county where the victim lives or where the harassment/stalking has taken place. The SAVIP Office and DLES are available to help assist with the application process and provide support for students who pursue this option.
 Notification of Outcomes
 The alleged student accused and the alleged victim are notified simultaneously at the OSC hearing and in writing of the outcome of the proceeding.
 Appeals
 Both an accused student and alleged victim may appeal the outcome of the OSC hearing. If one student submits an appeal, the other student in the OSC case will be notified. The other student will have five University business days to submit an appeal if he/she chooses. After the five days, the appeal(s) will be sent to the Vice President of Student Affairs and Academic Support for consideration at which time all appeal opportunities are closed.
 Hearing outcomes from the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity or designee (including the Carolina Judicial Council) that meet the criteria for appeal must be submitted via an appeal form within five University business days from the date the decision letter is received. The OSC will forward it with a response memorandum to the Vice President of Student Affairs.
 An appeal may be made for one or both of the following reasons:
 •   A procedural error was committed that has significantly prejudiced the findings of the Hearing Council; OR •   New evidence that could not have been available at the time of the hearing and would have a significant effect on the outcome of the case becomes available.
 Decisions not appealed within five University business days are final. Both the charged student and accuser will be notified simultaneously and in writing of the outcome of the appeal or any changes to the decision or withdrawal of an appeal by either party.
 Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention Office (SAVIP)
 Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention (SAVIP) is housed in Student Health Services and is located on the second floor of the Thomson Building. SAVIP provides 24/7 confidential interpersonal violence advocacy for anyone on the UofSC-Columbia campus who is impacted by sexual harassment and assault, relationship violence (all forms of relationships), stalking and harassment. SAVIP also provides primary prevention education on topics that include but are not limited to healthy relationships, consent, bystander intervention, and survivor support.
 Advocacy services offered include:
 •   24/7 access to confidential interpersonal violence advocates;
 •   Academic assistance;

 •   Referrals assistance to other campus and community resources.
 Students, staff and faculty who are impacted by any type of interpersonal violence can request any of the services listed above to prevent unnecessary or unwanted contact with their assailant, when reasonably available.
 A major role of SAVIP is to provide 24/7 on-call services to assist students, faculty and staff in addition to prevention education to all students, faculty and staff on campus regarding sexual assault and all forms of interpersonal violence.The staff regularly provide workshops and training sessions for University faculty and staff, residential student staff, academic classes, and student organizations . SAVIP staff and trained peer educators provide workshops to students, particularly through University 101 classes offered to first-year students .Topics includebystanderaccountability,healthyrelationships,consent,survivorsupport,stalking,relationship/datingviolence,andsexualassault.
 SAVIP provides survivors options for counseling, medical treatment (if needed), and reporting. Sexual assault survivors may have the option to complete a sexual assault forensic exam at a local emergency room (recommended hospital is Prisma Health Richland, located at 5 Medical Park Dr., Columbia, SC 29203); survivors who may be interested in this option are encouraged to call SAVIP at 803-777-8248 (this is a crisis line and is in operation 24/7, with the exception of Winter Break) and a confidential advocate can review the survivor’s options. If a survivor chooses a forensic exam, a SAVIP advocate can provide accompaniment to the emergency room. SAVIP advocates also review reporting options that include law enforcement and the Office of Civil Rights andTitle IX. For law enforcement reporting, survivors must report in the jurisdiction in which the crime occurred. They may report to the OCRTIX office if a UofSC student, staff, or faculty member is the alleged respondent. SAVIP staff provides support and assistance for students that pursue disciplinary procedures and file criminal charges”.
 If you have any questions about services mentioned or would like to receive additional information, call Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention at 803-777-8248 (available 24/7) or go to the Thomson Building during business hours (8:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. during fall & spring semesters, 8:30 a.m.-4:30 p.m. during summer & other breaks) and one of the advocates in the office will be able to provide assistance .
 Information and resources for those impacted by interpersonal violence can be found at https://bit.ly/2Jx6vdX.
 Guidelines for Assistance for Sexual Assault Victims
 If you or someone you know is sexually assaulted:
 •   Get to a safe place as soon as you can, and call 911 to contact emergency services if needed or to call an ambulance if you believe you may be seriously injured; you may call SAVIP (24/7) at (803)777-8248 to receive sup- port and discuss options for immediate care and for reporting, if that is what the survivor wishes. A SAVIP advocate can provide accompaniment to the hospital if that is what the survivor wants.
 •   Try to preserve physical evidence. Do not wash, use the toilet, or change clothing if you can avoid it. If you do change clothes, put all clothes you were wearing at the time of the assault in a paper, not plastic bag.
 •   Get medical attention as soon as possible to make sure you are physically well and to permit collection of import- ant evidence in the event you may later wish to take legal action.
 •   Contact a law enforcement agency to report the assault.
 •   Talk with an advocate or counselor who will maintain confidentiality, help explain your options, give you informa- tion, and provide emotional support.
 •   Contact someone you trust for initial and ongoing support.
 If an individual does not want to file a criminal complaint with DLES, they may still seek restorative justice by filing a complaint directly with the Office of Civil Rights and Title IX and inquiring with SAVIP about their options. Help and support are always available through SAVIP, Counseling and Psychiatry services, and other community resources.
 Sexual Assault, Relationship, and Dating Violence Programs
 The University of South Carolina prohibits dating violence, domestic violence, sexual assault, and stalking.To raise awareness of those issues and to assist survivors of such violence, the University offers a number of resources to the campus community.
 The University utilizes a website to inform the campus community of issues involving interpersonal violence, including sexual assault.The websitewww.sc.edu/interpersonalviolenceisaone-stopdestinationforinterpersonalviolenceresources,toincludeinterpersonalviolencet prevention and education programs and resources for survivors.
 One of the primary University support units dealing with all forms of interpersonal violence is Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention & Prevention (SAVIP). SAVIP is located in the Thomson Building. Its advocates offer support and services to students, faculty, and staff whoaresurvivors ofinterpersonal violence which includes sexual assault, attempted sexual assault, relationship/dating violence,domestic violence, stalking, and/or harassment.
 SAVIP provides educational programming and training throughout the year (see below for a list of programs and trainings). SAVIP also coordinates annual campus-wide campaigns to raise awareness and promote prevention of interpersonal violence. Notable campaigns include Relationship Violence Awareness in October, Stalking Awareness in January, and Sexual Assault Awareness in April.
 SAVIP recognizes Relationship Violence Awareness Month (RVAM) with events designed to increase awareness about intimate partner violenceasamajorsocialissue.RVAMeventsincludetablingandeducationalsessionsdesignedtoraiseawarenessofdatingandrelationship violence, how to recognize warning signs, as well as how to foster healthy relationships, and how to find services for those impacted by relationship violence.
 SAVIP recognizes Stalking Awareness Month with tabling and educational events aimed at fostering understanding about stalking and harassment. They educate the University Community about stalking methods, including the use of technology, the Rave Guardian app, options for those who are stalked and how to find services for those impacted by stalking.
 SAVIP recognizes Sexual Assault Awareness Month (SAAM) with events aimed at fostering understanding the effects of sexual assault while promoting a culture of healing and accountability. SAAM events encourage members of the University Community to utilize bystander intervention methods to prevent sexual assault and other forms of interpersonal violence.Through education, campaigns, and bystander accountability, SAVIP actively seeks to foster a Carolina community of respect, trust, equality, and healthy relationships.
 Gamecocks Stand Up – Bystander Intervention Program
 SAVIP promotes bystander accountability through Gamecocks Stand Up, bystander intervention education that includes four bystander intervention strategies and resources on and off-campus for those involved in harmful or negative situations.
 The scope of Gamecocks Stand Up is diverse, offering informational material, training for students, faculty, and staff, classroom presenta- tions, and outreach events.
 A “bystander” is a person who observes a situation or event but is not directly involved in it. For example, if you’re walking down the sidewalk and see two cars collide but you don’t get involved you are a bystander to the event. At the other end of the spectrum are“active . bystanders”These   are people who notice a harmful situation is about to happen, is currently happening or has already happened, and then they make a conscious decision to step in and intervene. In the previous scenario, an active bystander would see the collision but stop to call USCPD and report the incident.
 Changing Carolina Peers Leaders
 Changing Carolina Peer Leaders (CCPL) program is a student-run organization that works to educate, advocate for, and engage with peers by connecting students to on-campus resources. Students work toward inclusive and diverse programs on sexual health, healthy relation- ships, mental health, and general wellness to promote health equity for all members of the campus community.
 Changing Carolina Peer Leaders is a member group of the national peer education student organization BACCHUS Initiatives of NASPA.
