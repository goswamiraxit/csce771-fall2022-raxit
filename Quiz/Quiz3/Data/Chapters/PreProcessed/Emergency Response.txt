 Emergency Response, Notification, and Evacuation
 When it is determined that there is an emergency or dangerous situation that poses an imminent threat to the safety or health of the Carolina Community, specific University personnel are responsible for activating the Carolina Alert System. The University will immedi- ately notify the appropriate segment(s) of campus using one or more of the communication mediums in the Carolina Alert System.
 Uponreceivingareportornotificationregardingasignificantemergencyordangeroussituationinvolvinganimmediatethreattothesafety or health of the University of South Carolina Community, the University will confirm the emergency or dangerous situation and determine the content before initiating an emergency notification. Notification may not be made if it would compromise or impede efforts to assist victim(s), or contain, respond to, or mitigate the emergency.
 Activation Authority
 It is the responsibility of the following authorized persons to confirm an emergency, determine the appropriate segment(s) of the campus community to receive a notification, determine the content of the message, and initiate the selected communication media within the Carolina Alert emergency notification system:
 •   University’s Division of Law Enforcement and Safety On-Duty Supervisor;
 •   University’s Division of Law Enforcement and Safety (DLES) Emergency Management Coordinator;
 •   DLES Officer with the rank of Lieutenant or above;
 •   DLES Deputy Chief;
 •   DLES Associate Vice President/Chief of Police; and
 •   Chairperson, University’s Executive Policy Group.
 When it is appropriate, the authorized individuals (or their designees) will consult the next person in the chain of communication before sending an emergency message. However, if the next person is unavailable, or if time does not allow for a delayed warning, approval is not necessary.
 Confirmation of an Emergency
 If the person(s) authorized to send a message has not confirmed the emergency first-hand, they will contact the DLES on-duty shift supervisortoreceiveanupdate.Theymayalsochoosetocontactsurroundinglawenforcementagenciesandemergencyresponseagencies for more information.
 Determining Where on Campus to Send Notifications
 Those authorized to send a message will also determine which segment(s) of campus will be notified.
 The entire campus community may be notified if there is the potential for a very large segment of the community to be affected by the situation, or when the situation threatens the operation of the entire campus.
 If emergency conditions are isolated to a specific part of campus, notifications may be made to that specific area instead of notifying the entire campus. As the incident progresses, personnel will monitor the situation and notify additional areas of the campus if needed.
 Communication Media
 The following is a list of communication media the University may use to send an emergency notification:
 •   Carolina Alert Website: visit www.sc.edu/CarolinaAlert;
 •   Facebook;
 •   Twitter;
 •   University Website www.sc.edu;
 •   Outdoor Warning Sirens;
 •   Tone Alert Radios;
 •   Voice Over Fire Alarms;
 •   Digital Signage;
 •   Alert FM;
 •   Text Alerts;
 •   E-mail;
 •   Emergency Information Line;
 •   90.5 WUSC Radio;
 •   Blackboard Announcement;
 •   Fire Alarm;
 •   Vehicle Public Address Speakers;
 •   Bullhorns; and/or
 •   Media Advisory.
 Not all media will be used for every notification. Every incident is unique, and authorized personnel will use communication methods based on their reach, effectiveness and location.
 The following guidelines are used to assist authorized personnel with selecting communication media, and to provide the community an understanding as to which forms of communication may be used in different scenarios.
 Requires Action: If a situation exists that poses an immediate safety risk and requires persons to change their behavior (e.g. seek shelter, evacuate), information may be pushed using disruptive media (e.g. sirens, Alert FM, text messages, TV message crawler).
 Public Notification: If a situation exists where persons should be notified about an incident that is not immediately life threatening (e.g. crime alerts, situations that have already been contained), media such as the Carolina Alert website, social media, or others may be used to communicate the information.
 Determination of Message Content
 The person(s) authorized to send a message will also determine the content of the message. There are a number of pre-scripted, pre-ap- proved messages from which authorized person(s) may choose from.
 Initiating the Notification System
 Once the authorized person has confirmed the emergency, selected the areas of campus that need to be notified, chosen the appropriate communicationmediatouse,anddeterminedthecontentofthemessage,he/shewillcallthepersonnelresponsibleforphysicallyactivating each individual communication method.
 Follow-Up Communication
 Once a mass notification is issued, the person who authorized the notification will immediately contact the University Emergency Manage- ment Team Executive Policy Group.
 The initial notification should be followed by a subsequent message(s) that provides greater detail of the incident and/or protective action recommendations. If the incident requires an extended response time, subsequent information releases should be done so at the discretion of the University Public Information Officer or designee.
 Disseminating Information to the Surrounding Community
 If a dangerous situation exists on campus that has the potential to affect the surrounding Columbia community, the person who authorized the alert will notify DLES dispatch to call Columbia – Richland 911 Communications Center, or the appropriate authority dependent on the nature and type of emergency, to make the determination to initiate its community notification process.
 Emergency Notification Tests
 The Carolina Alert System is tested at least once a year to ensure the system is operational and to introduce members of the Carolina community to the methods in which they can receive notifications during an emergency.The test also provides information regarding what to do in the event of an actual emergency.
 A summary oftheUniversity’s emergency response and evacuation procedures is distributed in conjunction with at least one annualtest per year.
 After each test or activation of the Carolina Alert system, a brief after action report is written to evaluate the event against measurable goals.This documentincludes: purpose, date / time, whether the test was announced or unannounced, participants, description,successes, shortcomings and corrective action recommendations.
