 Reporting Criminal Incidents and Other Emergencies
 Reporting to the Division of Law Enforcement and Safety
 All on-campus crimes, suspicious activity, and safety concerns should be reported to DLES as soon as possible.
 There are several ways to make a report or contact law enforcement, depending on where you are located and what is occurring.
 On-Campus:
 Call. If you are experiencing an emergency or someone is badly injured and cannot be easily transported, call 911. For non-emergencies, call 803-777-4215 to have an officer come gather the information and collect any evidence.
 OR
 Visit. You may also visit DLES at 1415 Henderson Street, Columbia, South Carolina.
 Off-Campus:
 Call. If you are the victim or witness to a crime off-campus, dial 9-1-1 and the law enforcement agency responsible for that jurisdiction will be contacted.
 When you contact law enforcement, you will be asked questions about what happened, including:
 •   Your name and telephone number;
 •   The type of incident;
 •   The location of the incident of which you are reporting;
 •   A detailed description of the suspect(s)and his/her location or direction of travel;
 •   A detailed description of any vehicle involved in the incident; and
 •   Any need for medical assistance.
 RAVE Guardian App:
 The University provides a FREE mobile app, Rave Guardian, to keep students, faculty and staff safer on and off campus. Rave Guardian, available at , turns any cell phone into a personalized protection network, connecting with University Police during an emergency and enhancing safety through a virtual network of friends, family and campus law enforcement. Among its features:
 •   Caller profiles: Students, faculty and staff can set up complete profiles in Rave Guardian. By providing information about any medical conditions, course schedule, addresses, campus ID photo and other critical data, it is easier for campus police to help in an emergency.
 •   Panic Calls: These instantly connect with USC Police or with local 911. If the call is placed to USC Police, Rave Guardian automatically delivers the complete caller profile to telecommunications personnel.
 •   Safety networks: Safety timers notifies trusted “guardians” when the user doesn’t make it to a destination and deactivates the timer.
 •   Anonymous crime tips: Allows dispatchers to alert the appropriate agency.
 Campus Security Authorities
 Campus Security Authorities (CSAs) are individuals and organizations associated with the University that must disclose reports of Clery Crimes to DLES. CSAs include those who have significant responsibility for student activities.
 CSAs can take reports of crimes from members of the University Community who may not feel comfortable going directly to law enforcement, or who may come in contact with a CSA before having a chance to go to law enforcement. An accuser/reporter that reports a crime to a CSA does not have to prove that they were the victim or witness of a crime. Any report received in good faith (meaning without malice, and not based on rumor or hearsay) by a CSA must be reported to DLES.
 Each year DLES sends a written request for statistical information to the following Campus Security Authorities:
 •   The Vice President for Student Affairs and all CSAs who work for him/her;
 •   The Provost and all CSAs who work for him/her;
 •   The General Counsel and all CSAs who work for him/her;
 •   The Vice President for Human Resources and all CSAs who work for him/her;
 •   The Associate Vice President of Student Affairs and all CSAs who work for him/her;
 •   The Assistant Vice President for Civil Rights and Title IX and all CSAs who work for him/her;
 •   The Athletics’ Director and all CSAs who work for him/her; and
 •   The Director of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity and all CSAs who work for him/her.
 Emergency Call Boxes
 Over 300 emergency call boxes are located in visible places on the USC Columbia Campus and are constantly monitored. Emergency call boxes are topped with blue lights and give people on and around campus a fast way to contact DLES in an emergency. To activate, push the large button on the front of the call box. You will immediately be connected to a DLES dispatcher. If you are unable to communicate, the dispatcher will send an officer to your location. If you are unable to stop and wait at the first call box you come to, continue moving after activating the call box. Push the button on the next available call box, and continue activating call boxes as long as you encounter them. This allows dispatch to know which way you are traveling, so they may send assistance to your area.
