Criminal statistics

How We Compile These Statistics

A primary part of the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report is the statistics related to crime that have occurred at the University during the
preceding calendar year. To assist in evaluating the statistics in context, the preceding three calendar years are provided for your review.

DLES, in compiling the annual statistics, coordinates with law enforcement partners as well as University Campus Security Authorities.
DLES, along with the Richland County Sheriff’s Department and the City of Columbia Police Department, share information about
criminal incidents through the Lexis/Nexis Community Crime Map.




Community Crime Map

The Community Crime Map (www.communitycrimemap.com) is a crime mapping program made available to both the general public and
law enforcement.The program allows site visitors to see crime data over a map of the county. Through the Community Crime Map system,
DLES, the Richland County Sheriff’s Department, and City of Columbia Police Department can share crime data, crime intelligence, and
criminal reports. This program also allows DLES, when compiling the Annual Security and Fire Safety Report to directly retrieve informa-
tion about crimes occurring off campus or on public property investigated by another agency.

A public version of the Community Crime Map program is also available. The public system allows a user to search crimes by address or by
clicking on Columbia, South Carolina.The user interface shows a map of a particular area with incidents clearly marked. By clicking on the
incident location pin, the user obtains basic information about the incident such as: type of crime; location type; block-level address; and
incident date and time.




Sex Offender Data

Sex offender data is maintained and provided by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), which may be accessed via the
following link: http://scor.sled.sc.gov

Registered sex offenders are prohibited from living in Campus Student Housing. Individuals found in the registry are not necessarily
students, faculty, or staff. Individuals registered may carry on a vocation at the University of South Carolina such as a contractor or subcon-
tractor.




Crime Data

The Clery Act requires the University to report data regarding specific crimes that happen within a defined geographical area to the United
States Department of Education and then disclose the data to the general community. This area is referred to as “Clery Geography” and
encompasses On Campus (including the subset of On Campus Residence Halls), Non-Campus, and Public Property. These terms create
consistency in the way crime data is collected and reported across college campuses.

   For purposes of the Clery Act and understanding disclosed data, the following definitions are used:
   1) On-Campus is defined as either –
   a. Any property –
   Owned or controlled by the University;
   That is reasonably contiguous to other University owned property; and
   That is used by the University in direct support or in relation to the University’s educational purpose.



   OR

   b. Any property –
   Owned but not controlled by the University;
   That is used frequently by University students; and
   That is used to support the University’s educational purpose.


   2) Non-Campus is defined as either –
   a. Any property –
   Owned or controlled by the University;
   That is used by the University to support its educational purposes;
   That is frequently used by students; and
   Is not considered part of the core campus.
   OR
   b. Any property –
   Owned or controlled by a student organization; and
   That the student organization is officially recognized by the University.


   3) Public Property is defined as any property
   Owned or controlled by governmental entities such as thoroughfares, streets, sidewalks, and parking facilities;
   That is within the campus, or immediately adjacent to and accessible from the campus.


   An example of On-Campus property would be many of the University classrooms and buildings located throughout
   its core campus. Non-Campus areas include Williams-Brice Stadium. Public property would be the public sidewalk
   located in front of the Horseshoe.
